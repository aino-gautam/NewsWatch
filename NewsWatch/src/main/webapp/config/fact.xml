<TI>Podcast interviews Fat Boy Chronicles author</TI>
<TEXT>Featured in this weeks podcast, Kids Beating Obesity, is the story of young teenager Jimmy Winterpock and his incredible journey as an overweight youngster dealing with the horrors of being picked on, made fun of and bullied.
Our guest is Michael Buchanan, co-author of the book The Fat Boy Chronicles, and writer of the screenplay for the full-length movie of the same name.
The story really hits home with the constant reminder of yet another part of the childhood obesity nightmare  not just all the health risks and problems like high blood pressure, diabetes, muscle and joint problems  but the bullying and
psychological side.
Inspired by a true story, The Fat Boy Chronicles offers Jimmys school journal taking us into his daily thoughts and actions through a school term. This book and movie is most definitely something both kids and their parents should make a
priority.
Mike Buchanan and co-author Diane Lang are former teachers, and they bring great insight into this powerful story.
By the way, highlights of some past podcasts of Kids Beating Obesity featuring guests in the physical education field is available in the show previous to our interview with Mike Buchanan.
Get access to all of the podcasts, check topics and bios of all guests, by going to
, click new media, Kids Beating Obesity.
Lets get some emails:
Gerry, Plainfield: My son and I saw you at new Balance Naperville at your foot screening to check his flat feet.
At 13 years old, he is 25 pounds overweight, and his feet and knees hurt. Are these factors related?
Dr. Weil: Yes they are. Excessive weight will aggravate all the joints of the lower extremities. Orthotics can reduce the flat foot-related foot and knee stress, but the added weight makes things worse.
Steve, Naperville: My 15-year-old daughter is a serious club tennis player who is always dealing with shin splints. Her physical therapist mentioned orthotics. Would they help?
Dr. Weil: Absolutely  most persistent lower leg shin problems are foot mechanics related (go to Nov. 10, 2009, article common place shin pain is treatable at sportsdoctorradio.com/newspaper articles). Orthotics and foot, lower leg muscle
strengthening exercises will make a difference. Call me with questions.
Dr. Robert A. Weil is a sports podiatrist with an office in Aurora. You can hear him on his weekly radio show at 6:30 p.m. Thursdays on 90.9 FM. Visit his website at

<TI>ProActive Kids program has kids on road to health</TI>
<TEXT>These days when 9-year-old Bryson Taylor reaches for an afternoon snack, its more likely to be a bunch of grapes than the bag of potato chips he would have picked just weeks ago, his mom, Jenny, says.
This is just one of several healthy changes that Bryson and his family have made since January when he started the free, eight-week ProActive Kids (PAK) program at the Edward Health &amp; Fitness Center (EHFC) in Woodridge.
Weve also been shopping for resistance bands, and we hope to buy a treadmill in the near future, Jenny says.
The PAK Foundation, whose mission is to reduce childhood obesity, one community at a time, also offers the program in Wheaton where the organization has headquarters
PAK partners with organizations, such as Edward Hospital, to deliver the program, which is designed for kids 8 to 14 years old who struggle with unhealthy weight.
Partnering with ProActive Kids appealed to us because it focuses on kids, and its comprehensive, says Cheryl Eck, Edwards director of E-Health. Unlike a lot of programs that only cover diet and exercise, PAK also addresses social and emotional
issues that can get in the way of developing healthier habits.
PAK at EHFC meets from 4 to 5:30 p.m. on Monday and Wednesday, and from 4 to 6 p.m. on Friday. On each of these days, a PAK-certified personal trainer leads a 45-minute fitness class to increase muscular strength, cardiovascular endurance and
flexibility. In another segment, a registered dietitian from Edward takes the kids through nutrition basics.
We now all read labels in the grocery store, Jenny says.
Another key member of the team is a licensed professional counselor from Linden Oaks at Edward. She leads discussions and fun activities that promote self-esteem and good coping techniques  such as how to handle bullying.
Participants parents and siblings are invited to attend the Friday sessions, so they too can benefit from the program. This also helps them provide long-term support to the child whos enrolled.
On Fridays the families complete two exercise circuits and some stretches, and theres usually a review of that weeks nutrition sessions, Jenny says. There also might be activities with the therapist. One week Brysons group broke up into pairs, and
each person wrote something they liked about their partner and vice versa. Then each family did the same thing.
My son looks forward to the program, and his body fat is down 3.4 percent, Jenny says. His fat mass also is down  1.5 percent, and his fat free mass is up 4.5 percent, which means more muscle.
As I told Bryson, we see this as an opportunity to build a good foundation for the future. Its more about lifestyle than losing weight. And he even gets a side benefit of extra training for the upcoming soccer season.
A physician referral is required for children to participate in the program. The spring session of PAK at EHFC runs April 2 through May 25. To enroll, call 630-681-1558 or visit
to learn more.

<TI>Media Lifeline: Boris Johnson</TI>
<TEXT>It seems the Twittersphere is one of the key battlegrounds in this year&apos;s London Mayor elections.
December 2009 ...
Boris Johnson is rapped by the Greater London Authority&apos;s standards committee for using his official Mayor of London Twitter feed to celebrate The Sun&apos;s decision to back the Tory Party in the forthcoming General Election.
19 March 2012 ...
But has he learned his lesson? As campaigning for the 2012 mayoral election begins in earnest, the official @mayoroflondon Twitter account mysteriously morphs overnight into @borisjohnson. At a stroke, Johnson&apos;s Twitter campaign acquires more than
250,000 followers - and the account&apos;s weblink is changed from
to
.
20 March 2012 ...
His election rivals, including Ken Livingstone, are outraged. A member of Livingstone&apos;s campaign team delivers a blistering indictment: &apos;Basically, taxpayers&apos; money has been spent to build up and maintain a feed that Boris has now hijacked.&apos;
21 March 2012 ...
Johnson&apos;s team had initially defended his actions, claiming that the account is owned by Twitter, not the taxpayer, and that it was his &apos;brand&apos; and personality that had attracted followers to the site in the first place. Then a post on Johnson&apos;s
campaign website claims that, with regard to Twitter, he has been acting all along in the interests of openness and honesty - and he is mystified by all the hysteria Strangely, though, this post is now deleted.
22 March 2012 ...
Johnson, who&apos;d set up @backboris2012, then returns all the followers he&apos;d seized to @mayoroflondon, mothballs @borisjohnson and gets down to serious campaigning. &apos;Boris meets commuters at Wimbledon station,&apos; @backboris2012 crows; &apos;I&apos;m launching
the fare deal express,&apos;
@ken4london responds. Brian Paddick waits a day to Tweet the devastating: &apos;With members of the Barking Gospel Oak User Group in Haringey this morning.&apos;
Fast forward ...
2 May 2012: During the campaign, @backboris2012 had been flooding the social media space with pictures of Johnson pestering commuters at Wimbledon station; and @ken4london had responded with an endless stream of pictures of the Livingstone
battlebus going round and round the Elephant and Castle roundabout. But now @brianpaddick lands a critical blow. &apos;Hello. Hope everyone is enjoying the lovely weather,&apos; he Tweets.

<TI>The one-cent solution</TI>
<TEXT>OTTAWA -- Canada is scrapping the penny, ending production this year of a coin that weighs down consumers&apos; pockets while adding little to their purchasing power.
The government announced in Thursday&apos;s federal budget that it will shortly jettison the one-cent coin  a casualty of Ottawa&apos;s drive for efficiency and thrift.
It costs taxpayers a penny-and-a-half every time we make one, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told the Commons, adding the move will save taxpayers $11-million annually.
Mr. Flaherty, whose department described the penny as a nuisance in budget documents, said the 2.35-gram coin is now more trouble than it&apos;s worth.
Pennies take up too much space on our dressers at home, Mr. Flaherty added. They take up far too much time for small businesses trying to grow and create jobs.
The last one-cent coin will be minted this April, ending what federal officials say is close to 150 years of Canadian penny production. The Royal Canadian Mint will stop distributing pennies to financial institutions in the fall of 2012 and the
government will work to withdraw one-cent coins from circulation.
The increasing scarcity of pennies means Canadians will have to get used to cash transactions being rounded off if they&apos;ve got no pennies on hand.
Ottawa is suggesting businesses round off cash transactions to the nearest five-cent increment but says it&apos;s leaving this to businesses to work out for themselves.
This rounding off would occur after taxes had been applied to the purchase and would not be necessary for credit or debit transactions.
Retailers and restaurateurs, however, are urging Ottawa to clearly explain to Canadians what is happening to cash transactions  so customers don&apos;t feel they&apos;re getting ripped off and that there&apos;s a level playing field for all businesses.
Not everyone is relieved to see the one-cent coin abolished.
As a coin collector, it&apos;s a black day because the penny has been such an integral part of Canadian history. When Canada was young, a penny was a lot of money, said Brian Grant Duff with All Nations Stamp and Coin in Vancouver.
He predicted the five-cent coin&apos;s days are now numbered too.
The Royal Canadian Mint produced 660 million pennies in 2011, federal officials said.
The Canadian government is hardly alone in scrapping the penny. Federal officials said they could count at least 17 other countries that have ceased production of low-denomination coins over the past four decades.
The Harper government says savings for business and consumers will vastly exceed what Ottawa recoups by killing the penny.
A study by one Canadian financial institution, Desjardins Group, estimates the economic costs of the penny for the private sector total $150-million annually. This includes counting, storing and transporting the coins.
Ottawa says it won&apos;t be policing consumer-business transactions, but added that businesses are expected to round prices in a fair, consistent and transparent manner.
It couldn&apos;t guarantee consumers would be better off but cited a 2005 Bank of Canada study that concluded the inflationary impact of eliminating the penny would be small or non-existent.
The government had no estimates Thursday on how many pennies remain in circulation, including those piling up in jars or cans. It noted that the study by Desjardins Group estimates Canadians could be hoarding several billion pennies.
Federal officials said more than 35 billion pennies have been minted in Canada in the past 104 years. This, they noted Thursday, would weigh 94 million kilograms  or as much as 1,500 Leopard 2 tanks.
The federal government says it will encourage charities to collect pennies from Canadians and redeem them through banks and the mint as a fundraising venture.</TEXT>

<TI>Strong proponent of breastfeeding</TI>
<TEXT>AURORA  Since the 1980s, Rush-Copley Hospital has helped new mothers master the art of breastfeeding their babies. Now a $33,700 grant from the March of Dimes Illinois chapter will help the hospital hire experienced breastfeeding moms to help
patients in its lactation center.
Were very grateful to the March of Dimes for giving us the opportunity to expand our lactation services, said Jennifer Toerpe, director of Rush-Copleys Womens Health Institute. Its so important for us to support breastfeeding in Kane and Kendall
counties.
The March of Dimes primary goal is preventing premature births.
The longer a mother breastfeeds, the better her chances for well-spaced pregnancies, which also decreases her risk of preterm deliveries, said Dr. Victoria Nichols Johnson, a member of the March of Dimes Illinois Chapter Program Services
Committee. Other benefits include a decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, and more rapid postpartum weight loss.
Medical associations throughout the U.S. agree that feeding babies nothing but breast milk for six to 12 months gives them lifelong health benefits, Toerpe said.
Breastfeeding supports weight gain and brain development. It gives babies immunity against diseases and helps them bond with their mothers, she said. Babies that dont breastfeed have increased risk of obesity, allergies and heart disease. For that
reason, the Healthy People 2020 program has set a goal that at least 80 percent of mothers try breastfeeding and at least 60 percent of them breastfeed exclusively for six months or more.
But many women choose never to breastfeed their babies, or to stop breastfeeding after a few weeks, for a number of reasons, Toerpe said. Sometimes they stop because they must return to work and cant pump breast milk at their jobs. Sometimes they
give up on breastfeeding after having trouble or pain with it. Sometimes they refuse to breastfeed because they want to preserve their pre-pregnancy figures, or because they grew up believing that only poor or rural people dont use formula.
There are many cultural and societal influences that lead women not to breastfeed their babies, Toerpe said. Some say that its not natural or that they dont want to do it in public. Teens and older moms are less likely to breastfeed because they
usually cant stay home with their babies as long as women in their 20s and 30s can.
Several years ago Rush-Copley stopped giving formula samples to new mothers who give birth there. Instead, a lactation specialist gives them information about the differences between breast milk and formula, as well as advice and instructions
about how to make sure their babies are breastfeeding properly.
It was so helpful to have the lactation consultants working with latching the baby and showing me what to do, said Jenny Searls, who recently gave birth to a boy at Rush-Copley. They were so kind and positive, and really wanted me to succeed. I
really felt like I was part of a team vs. being on my own.
The lactation center also offers community education classes on breastfeeding, outpatient consultations and free baby weight checks as well as free or reduced-cost rentals of breast pumps.
While the percentage of Rush-Copleys maternity patients who breastfeed has fallen from just more than 90 percent to 86 percent in the past few years, the hospital still boasts one of the best breastfeeding rates in the state, Toerpe said. Several
new programs that the March of Dimes grant will pay for could boost the percentage back over 90 percent, she added.
The first step will be hiring two peer counselors  experienced breastfeeding mothers who can relate to new moms struggling with breastfeeding as equals rather than medical figures. The peer counselors also will visit medical clinics throughout the
Aurora area to enlist obstetricians, pediatricians and family practitioners in the quest to support breastfeeding as a parenting choice. The peer counselors should be on staff by the end of March, Toerpe said.
Grant money also will fund new brochures about breastfeeding; a tracking program to find out how many patients continue breastfeeding for six months or longer; and interconception care for women who are not yet pregnant but who plan to be soon.
Healthier women are more likely to breastfeed than women with chronic health issues like obesity, diabetes or heart disease, Toerpe said.
These types of care are in line with the March of Dimes mission  the reason the hospital received the grant.
Rush-Copley was selected for their innovation, multidisciplinary approach, and ability to infuse components of interconception care education and the benefits of breastfeeding, said Shelly Musser, associate state director for March of Dimes
Program Services and Public Affairs. Interconception care is care that a woman gets between pregnancies, which can help lower risk and promote wellness among women of childbearing age.
The program expansion this years money will fund will continue next year, even if the March of Dimes does not renew the grant, Toerpe said.
Weve always been a strong proponent of breastfeeding, she said. As the fourth-largest maternity center in the state, located in the second-largest city in the state, we need to keep promoting breastfeeding for the health of our community.</TEXT>

<TI>Cellmid Launches volis Hair Products</TI>
<TEXT>The first clinically validated hair growth product to be released in over two decades
Cellmid Limited (ASX: CDY) advises that it has commenced the commercial launch of its Evolis(TM) hair growth products with an event in Sydney for representatives of the national printed and electronic media yesterday. The products have received
celebrity endorsement from Paula Duncan, AM. The press release for the event can be accessed here.
In February 2012 Cellmid advised that it had received TGA approval and expected completion of the GMP manufacture and commercial launch of the Evolis(TM) products in May 2012. These events have now been brought forward and commercial sale of the
products through pharmacies is likely to commence in the middle of the calendar year, three months earlier than previously planned.
The Evolis(TM) for Men and Evolis(TM) for Women products have important TGA approved claims of &quot;promotes hair growth&quot;, &quot;helps prevent hair loss and thinning&quot; and &quot;restores the natural hair growth cycle&quot;.
The Evolis(TM) products will not require a prescription and will be sold as over the counter medicines in individual pharmacies as well as pharmacy chains at the recommended retail price of $89 for each 50 ml bottle. The Company is targeting a
minimum of 400 pharmacies nationally within the first twelve months.
It is estimated that 40% of women and 50% of men in western countries are affected by hair loss at some stage in their life. Current hair growth products either have serious side effects or lack evidence of efficacy. The key competitive advantage
for the Evolis(TM) range is safety combined with efficacy and as such the products represent a significant market opportunity.
Cellmid, via its wholly owned subsidiary Advangen International Pty Ltd, holds exclusive manufacturing and distribution rights for the products in Australia, USA, Europe, India and South America with significant combined sales potential.
Commercial launch outside Australia is expected to commence in late 2012.
The website for the Evolis(TM) products will be re-launched on 15th April 2012 with a commercial interface to facilitate internet sales and a promotional video which will also be released on site in participating pharmacies.
About Cellmid Limited (ASX: CDY)

Advangen&apos;s products are based on using FGF-5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 5) inhibitors to prevent hair loss, extend the growth phase of the hair cycle and activate resting follicles prompting them to grow. FGF-5 is known to cause hair to fall out
and suppress hair growth. Its absence results in strong hair growth. FGF-5 has no other functions rendering its inhibitors safe. Advangen&apos;s FGF-5 inhibitor products are plant extracts that have been tested for their ability to inhibit FGF-5 with
propriety high through put assay. Several products have been developed, of which the Advangen range (Jo-Ju(TM) and Lexilis(TM))
will be sold through hair salons as cosmeceuticals. The Evolis(TM) range has been registered by the TGA as a listed medicine and will be sold as an over the counter product in pharmacies.

<TI>DIABETES: Gliptins backed for diabetes second line</TI>
<TEXT>Meta-analysis suggests gliptins have benefits over sulphonylureas
By David Swan
Gliptins should be used more widely in patients with diabetes as they are associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic episodes than sulphonylureas, say researchers.
A meta-analysis of 27 studies found both gliptins and incretins appeared to have benefits for weight loss over the older sulphonylureas and pioglitazone, in findings that could lead to a rewrite of the NICE algorithm for diabetes treatment.
NICE guidelines currently suggest using metformin first line and gliptins as alternatives to using sulphonylureas second line, but only if there is a considerable risk of hypoglycaemia or sulphonylureas are contraindicated or not tolerated.
The recommendation is based on studies carried out before 2009. The authors of the new meta-analysis found current evidence suggests gliptins should be used as a routine second-line treatment to metformin and that incretins might be suitable for
patients targeting weight loss.
The international group of researchers looked at randomised controlled trials of diabetes treatments involving 7,100 adults and found adding gliptins to metformin lowered HbA1c in a similar way to sulphonylureas and glitazones, with mean
differences between groups of 0.07% and 0.09%.
But patients taking gliptins and metformin gained less weight than those who were given sulphonylureas or glitazones with metformin, with differences between groups of -1.92kg and -2.96kg respectively.
In most trials comparing gliptins with sulphonylureas as add-on therapy to metformin, the risk of hypoglycaemia was higher in the group treated with a sulphonylurea.
Study leader Professor David Matthews, professor of diabetic medicine at the University of Oxford, said gliptins were a `good alternative&apos; to older treatments: `DPP-4 inhibitors [gliptins] can be used as second- line treatment in patients with
type 2 diabetes who do not achieve their glycaemic targets with metformin alone. But questions about their long-term safety still remain to be answered from ongoing trials.&apos;
He also pointed out the data did not include cost comparisons and that it suggested incretins might be even more powerful than gliptins when added to metformin: `For reductions in both HbA1c and body weight, our analysis suggests that GLP-1
agonists seem to have an advantage over DPP-4 inhibitors.&apos;
Dr Colin Kenny, a GP in County Down and a committee member of the Primary Care Diabetes Society, said the study should help GPs to prescribe gliptins according to the latest evidence.
`This is the first study of its type, and I think it&apos;s important as it helps clinicians decide where DPP-4 inhibitors fit in with type 2 diabetes treatment regimens,&apos; he said.
He added that he believed the cost of gliptins was an issue: `The cost differential of DPP-4 inhibitors compared with other drugs is stopping them from being more widely used.&apos;

<TI>Johnson feeling the love again - Once-disgruntled defender signs contract extension with Bombers</TI>
<TEXT>Jovan JOHNSON is finally happy. And also a little contrite.
The Winnipeg Blue Bombers announced Thursday that contentious off-season talks on a contract extension for the import cornerback -- which included Johnson going public on several occasions, including as recently as last week, with his displeasure
-- have concluded with a new deal for the CFL&apos;s Outstanding Defensive Player in 2011.
Johnson, who was headed into his option year in 2012, said he signed a new one-year deal, plus an option.
&quot;I just wanted to be sure where I was going to play at and be sure that, be confident, that the team I was going to play for wanted me,&quot; Johnson said in a teleconference Thursday afternoon. &quot;I&apos;d said that over and over and over again and that&apos;s
where I ultimately wanted to be...
&quot;Things worked out for me and the organization and I&apos;m looking forward to 2012.&quot;
That&apos;s a far cry from where Johnson was just last week, when he took to his Twitter account to express his frustration with the progress of negotiations.
&quot;This looks like it&apos;ll be my last season in BLUE and GOLD! I love all my fans- hope wherever I end up im loved!!,&quot; Johnson tweeted, later adding: &quot;Either take pennies and stay or go elsewhere and I&apos;m kinda in disbelief.&quot;
The tweets were an echo of more extended comments Johnson made to the Free Press in January in which he suggested he felt unappreciated by Bombers management after a historic 2011 season in which he became the first defensive back in CFL history
to be named outstanding defensive player.
Johnson quickly deleted his tweets last week and subsequently tweeted several apologies to Bombers fans and management, contrition he reiterated with reporters on Thursday.
&quot;Players make mistakes and I&apos;m a man and I admit that,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;I never had any intention of questioning our management and staff because they do a tremendous job of bringing in players and also signing players that we need. It was just one
of those things where emotionally I kind of got upset.
&quot;But it happens to the best of us and they look forward to me being a leader on this team and I look forward to going out and doing that. It starts with me and will go down all the way to whoever is the last player on our roster. You can&apos;t make
mistakes like that and I understand that.
&quot;It was definitely the reason I apologized so quickly (after the tweets). I thought about it and it definitely wasn&apos;t a good look for me as a player or for what people considered to be a shot at the organization. Because that&apos;s not at all the
case.&quot;
Johnson was vague when asked what changed so dramatically in negotiations between last week and this week.
&quot;Nothing really changed. Everything that happened is between me and management,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;We came to a mutual agreement and everything worked out for the best for both of us.&quot;
Bombers GM Joe Mack pointed out on Thursday that Johnson plays a larger role for the Bombers than just as a defender.
&quot;Clearly, Jovon Johnson is one of the marquee players in this league and we are thrilled to lock him down for the foreseeable future,&quot; Mack said in a statement. &quot;His versatility to play special teams in addition to his regular role on defence
makes him an even greater asset for us. We are looking for him to take a larger leadership role this season and are confident he is in a position to do so.&quot;
Johnson led the CFL in 2011 with eight interceptions -- returning two for touchdowns -- and he added 594 punt-return yards to move up to fourth on the Bombers&apos; all-time list. The 2012 season will be his fifth with the Bombers.
Johnson becomes the third player this week from last season&apos;s East Division champion squad to sign a contract extension. On Wednesday, the club announced non-import receivers Kito Poblah and Cory Watson had signed extensions.

<TI>Viral Video Chart: Anchorman 2, Downton Abbey, toddler sings Adele</TI>
<TEXT>Watch Ron Burgundy break the news about his new movie, and talented two-year-olds, in our rundown of the top online clips. By Dugald Baird
The headline news this week is the return of Will Ferrell in an Anchorman sequel. Ferrell chose to break the story himself on Conan O&apos;Brien&apos;s show in character as 1970s San Diego newscaster Ron Burgundy. There&apos;s some tasty jazz flute, plenty of
tasteless jokes, and a lot of anticipation about the movie. Let&apos;s just hope Baxter the dog gets plenty of screen time.
Elsewhere this week, we have Downton Abbey relocated to US fast food chain Arby&apos;s  would you order the Mr Bates burger? There&apos;s also a literary spoof of Jay-Z and Kanye West.
Finally, who could fail to resist a two-year-old toddler singing along to Adele? Two-year-old Makena doesn&apos;t quite get every word, but the words she does get are pretty good, and she keeps on singing like a pro. In a similar vein is another
talented two-year-old, this time dancing to Jailhouse Rock. Next stop America&apos;s Got Talent.

<TI>Abbott needs &apos;personal politics lesson&apos;</TI>
<TEXT>Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has again shown he needs a lesson in &quot;personal politics 101&quot; after making inappropriate remarks for a second time in a week, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon says.
Mr Abbott said on Friday he regretted a remark he made in reference to Prime Minister Julia Gillard&apos;s wardrobe and appearance.
Feminist Germaine Greer started the furore after she told an ABC TV panel that Ms Gillard wore unflattering jackets and had a &quot;big arse&quot;.
A woman speaking to Mr Abbott at a community forum in Victoria on Thursday raised the subject again saying: &quot;Get some of those jackets off her&quot; and he replied: &quot;I know, I know, I know. Germaine Greer was right on that subject.&quot;
Mr Abbott said he regretted the remark when quizzed on the Nine Network on Friday.
&quot;It was an off-the-cuff remark responding to an observation of a member of the public and I shouldn&apos;t have said it and I regret it,&quot; he said.
The latest verbal gaffe came just a week after Mr Abbott apologised in parliament for inappropriately saying Ms Gillard and the leader of the House of Representatives, Anthony Albanese, were &quot;walking around with targets on their foreheads&quot;.
Ms Roxon reminded reporters on Friday that Mr Abbott had abused Bernie Banton when he was dying from asbestos-induced fibrosis, and had &quot;happily&quot; swore at her (Ms Roxon) after a debate at the National Press Club.
&quot;This is Mr Abbott losing control and perhaps being under more pressure than he has been under in a while,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I also think this is Mr Abbott who needs a lesson on personal politics 101 which is, if your wife or girlfriend says, `Does my bum look big in this?&apos; you say, `No&apos; and get on with it.&quot;
She didn&apos;t think it was appropriate for anyone to comment on the prime minister&apos;s clothing, including Ms Greer.
&quot;Germaine Greer really didn&apos;t do herself proud in making those comments,&quot; she said.
Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten agreed, saying it was a case of an iconic feminist having a crack at another successful woman.
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have said what Tony Abbott said, it was just ridiculous,&quot; Mr Shorten told the Seven Network.
Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey told the same program it was a &quot;no-go area&quot; for any male to talk about female clothing.
But he told Fairfax radio that the way one dresses and presents themselves does matter because it forms part of the judgment made of an individual.
&quot;For example, I can say to you, with absolute confidence, that you&apos;re unlikely to see me in Speedos,&quot; he said.
But he said both Ms Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan had said some &quot;nasty things&quot; about him in the past.
&quot;For me it&apos;s water off a duck&apos;s back. It&apos;s no revelation that I&apos;m a fully sized guy,&quot; he said.
&quot;Frankly when you pass comment about someone&apos;s weight or something like that I think it says more about you than it does about them.&quot;</TEXT>

<TI>Daily £2 pill to protect against strokes is given go-ahead; The medical watchdog has given its backing to a new £2-a-day pill to help prevent stroke in people with an irregular heart rhythm.</TI>
<TEXT>The daily pill is the second drug to be recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) this month after it approved Pradaxa as an alternative to warfarin to stop blood clots.
Rivaroxaban costs just £2.10 a day and unlike the twice-a-day Pradaxa, patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) need only take it once every 24 hours to help thin the blood.
It works by suppressing a substance known as Factor Xa, which is an essential component in the process of clotting.
People with AF are at a greater risk of blood clots because the condition means irregular heart beats cannot properly pump blood around the body. The risk of a stroke increases fivefold in AF patients.
Nice issued draft guidance recommending the pill earlier this week for patients who have diagnosed with non-valvular AF with risk factors including congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes or a previous history of strokes.
Professor Carole Longson, Nice&apos;s health technology evaluation centre director, said: We know that people taking warfarin can find it difficult to maintain their blood clotting at a proper level and are often not within the target therapeutic
range.
&quot;For example, older people with atrial fibrillation and comorbidities are more likely to have poorly controlled clotting and may be at an increased risk of stroke or bleeding.
&quot;Rivaroxaban, like dabigatran etexilate, which Nice recently approved as an option for this indication, can benefit people with AF in these circumstances because it doesn&apos;t require such regular monitoring and dose adjustments.
Professor Longson added: We are pleased to say that the additional information and analysis received from the manufacturer following our initial draft guidance has enabled us to recommend rivaroxaban as a cost-effective option for the prevention
of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation.&quot;
Nice has opened a consultation on the draft guidance and until the body issues its final guidance, decisions will be made at regional levels on funding for treatments.</TEXT>

<TI>London election 2012 - Johnson controls.</TI>
<TEXT>Over the next three weeks, Property Week will be exploring London&apos;s hotly contested mayoral election. Today, Hardeep Sandher meets Boris Johnson.
The exclusive St Stephen&apos;s Club at Queen Anne&apos;s Gate in Westminster is the setting for Property Week&apos;s meeting with Boris Johnson. The 19th-century private members club, with its glass chandeliers and private garden, has played host to many a
well-known Tory, including Margaret Thatcher and Harold Macmillan - not to mention the overbearing painting of Winston Churchill that hangs in the reception.
Yet Boris, as he is known to Londoners, could hardly be more different from these Tory peers. He arrives clutching a handful of crumpled papers and receipts in his right hand, which - unintentionally, I am sure - match his wrinkled suit. He bounds
in - early - with a rucksack hanging off his left shoulder, mop of yellow hair flapping, and a buoyant jump in his step. He resembles a teenager, anxiously awaiting his first job interview, rather than a man with one of the country&apos;s biggest political
mandates.
A job interview of sorts is on the cards for Johnson. On 6 May it will be a little more than four years to the day since he secured a surprising win over Ken Livingstone in the battle to become mayor of London. In 2008, tired of Livingstone after
eight years, voters were won over by the &quot;BoJo&quot; charm.
This year, he is campaigning to entice the capital&apos;s voters away from Livingstone once again, as they go head to head for a second time in what is more or less a two-horse race.
As far as the property world is concerned, Johnson has remained an anomaly. He has not effected significant change for the industry, yet it has warmed to him considerably - the hubbub caused by his presence at the MIPIM conference in Cannes over
the years speaks for itself. The mayor, it seems, has similarly warm feelings towards property.
&quot;The property industry contributes massively to London and its beauty,&quot; he says. &quot;What they do so well is to integrate an ancient city with the best of modern architecture. It is rewarding to look at the imagination and flair that people are
bringing to it.&quot;
He pauses, before adding: &quot;Is that sufficiently pompous?&quot;
It is this wry humour that has attracted both praise and criticism of Johnson over the past four years. He admits that he uses it to &quot;defuse situations&quot;. To secure a second term, however, he needs to get serious.
London&apos;s economy is struggling to recover from the biggest financial crisis for more than 20 years, and the property industry is still largely on its knees when it comes to financing development in the capital.
After four years, the mayor&apos;s property plan is still unclear. His &quot;war on tall buildings&quot; has subsided since he took office, but affordable housing targets and the community infrastructure levy are still constraining development. The hostility
evident during the London riots was enough to put off some of our most important foreign investors.
Johnson says he only has one regret about the past four years: &quot;I became mayor just when the markets went off a cliff and my job has been to keep the city going. The worst thing you can do when something bad like that happens is to start cutting
investment in infrastructure and things ... so the critical battles I had to win over the past four years were all about securing Crossrail, Tube upgrades and keeping investment in policing.
&quot;And we have done that, by the way. Murder in London is down 25%. I mean, beat that, Paris. Beat that, New York. London has got to be a safe city - that is fundamental for property.&quot;
Building support
Property and the built environment seem to be fundamental to Johnson&apos;s re-election campaign. His priorities for a second term are leading the city out of recession, making the most of the Olympics and ensuring London has a long-term legacy from
the games. On the transport front, he intends to fight for more investment.
&quot;All the evidence shows that if we can get the transport stuff right, then that gives property developers the cue to move in,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s the big picture and from that everything else flows.&quot;
As an example, he cites &quot;VNEB&quot; - Vauxhall, Nine Elms and Battersea - where two new Northern Line Tube stations have been given the go-ahead. On the back of the stations, City Hall is co-ordinating regeneration of the city&apos;s largest undeveloped
area. I argue that there is a long way to go, as the stations will have to be funded through a community infrastructure levy on development sites in the area, which the private sector will struggle to afford. Wandsworth Council has set out proposals for
this to be up to £575/sq m on residential development.
&quot;But we are doing the transport works application right now,&quot; booms an excitable Johnson. &quot;The wheels are cranking into life. The great beast is beginning. It has lifted itself off its haunches, and it&apos;s moving towards the exit. My job now is to
sell that vision to the world.&quot;
Enticing investors
The vision is difficult to sell at a time when money is tight, demand is low and the locations Johnson aims to promote - such as the parcels of land across east London put together by the London Development Agency - are deemed high risk.
As an example, I cite the grade II-listed Battersea Power Station, up for sale through administrators from Ernst &amp; Young on behalf of NAMA (Ireland&apos;s National Asset Management Agency).
&quot;I understand the people who want to take a bulldozer to it,&quot; he replies. &quot;I am currently disposed to think that there is still life in some of the plans. And you can be quite creative. Not every brick of (architect Sir) Giles Gilbert Scott&apos;s
structure has to remain, does it?&quot;
And the investors that could create such a vision, could he attract them to London in a second term?
&quot;I don&apos;t think I have rosy spectacles or anything if I say that London still has immense appeal to international investors. We have the time zone, we have the language and we are signalling to the world that there are unsuspected bargains here.
&quot;You&apos;ll just think I am a salesman, but when I go to Davos and MIPIM, I don&apos;t just knock back the wine and come back empty-handed.&quot;
Johnson says he met an investor from Bahrain in Davos, Switzerland, last month who told him he wanted to spend £10bn in London.
&quot;That&apos;s the kind of enthusiasm out there,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to see deals done. I want to form those relationships with people.&quot;
His vision for promoting London is exactly what the property industry craves. But it has not been easy since images of Croydon and Tottenham on fire were beamed around the world during August 2011&apos;s riots. That episode will forever be remembered
as part of his mayoral term, particularly as he was on holiday at the time. He admits it was a terrible knock for London.
&quot;But we are working hard to repair things. (Sir) Stuart (Lipton) is doing some great work for us in Tottenham, where we secured £20m of funding to go into the area from DCLG (department for Communities and Local Government). The Olympics gives us
an opportunity to correct things this year.&quot;
It was Livingstone who worked alongside Lord Coe in 2004 to bring the games to London. But it is Johnson who is reaping the rewards and who plans to &quot;leverage the games&quot; to London&apos;s benefit this summer.
&quot;During games time, City Hall will be a kind of trade fair,&quot; says Johnson, speaking with the confidence that has helped to widen his lead over Livingstone in the latest poll this month.
&quot;I will shamelessly use City Hall to bring people together. As you know, we have a small number of tickets that we will give to people we think will bring the hundreds of millions of pounds to London.&quot;
It is not surprising that Derwent London chief executive John Burns refers to the mayor as an &quot;ambassadorial force&quot; in helping London to compete for investment when it was at its weakest. And in some ways it has worked: several new initiatives for
property have been announced since 2008.
The enterprise zone status of east London&apos;s Royal Docks has encouraged developers to consider regeneration strategies.
Johnson also lobbied to take control of the Homes and Communities Agency&apos;s London money and assets, which central government allocated to him after the break-up of the agency in 2010.
Johnson says his planning policies were simplified in 2010 through a review of the London Plan. And next week, the Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) will be launched to help to streamline planning applications on the Olympic Park legacy site,
in the hope of attracting investors. If he is re-elected, the planning processes could be further simplified, as the corporation&apos;s powers could be extended across London sites.
&quot;The MDC is innovative,&quot; says Johnson. &quot;(If it were to be extended to other sites,) it would mean boroughs&apos; prerogatives would be taken away, and we don&apos;t want to do that, unless they really want us to. But if the boroughs do want such powers ...
we would be keen to help.&quot;
The industry has accused him of confusing them with such initiatives and making the planning system unpredictable - he has used controversial powers, brought in by Livingstone, to overrule planning decisions several times in the past year.
Incoming Land Securities chief Robert Noel says that, although the industry thinks Johnson has done well, he needs to provide a steer on whether or not he is going to be pragmatic about affordable housing targets and tax, both of which make some
developments unviable.
Johnson says he does not have &quot;a one size fits all doctrine&quot; towards development.
&quot;As mayor, you have to keep working, working, working, to compete on things where we need to improve. Housing, transport, regeneration. That is why I want to be mayor, to fight for it and make London the best place to live in the world,&quot; he says.
&quot;This city will grow by a million people in a decade and the need for housing will have to be dealt with sensitively. If people say they can&apos;t predict what I am going to say then that is a good thing. We look at the context and the local need.&quot;
In a lighter tone, he adds: &quot;I do enjoy these conversations with developers. I mean, these people are no slouches. They are clever people and they are not against things like affordable housing. They know what is good for London.&quot;
Game on
Does he know what is good for London better than his rival, who has promised a 7% cut in transport fares in a bid to win votes?
Johnson pauses for thought before he responds: &quot;The safest thing for an incumbent in any election is to focus on the future. The less said about competitors the better.&quot;
He cannot help but take a swipe at Ken: &quot;I will say, however, that to cut £1bn from Transport for London&apos;s budget is ludicrous. He doesn&apos;t really mean it. I don&apos;t think even if he did get into office - which he, I hope, won&apos;t - I don&apos;t believe he
will deliver it.&quot;
And with that, he is off, pulling on his beanie hat, teenage rucksack in tow - on his Boris bike.</TEXT>

<TI>Two nations divided by a common coffee; Our addiction to Starbucks, Costa and the like has never been stronger.</TI>
<TEXT>A few weeks ago in a New York Starbucks I had the chance to put to the test George Bernard Shaws maxim that America and Britain are two nations divided by a common language&quot;.
Jet-lagged, cold and thirsty after a misguided hour trying to walk to the Brooklyn Bridge, I fancied a cup of coffee. The barista, however, was determined to subject me to a rigorous inquisition first.
While I was already familiar with the ridiculous lingo of their cup sizes (venti, which means big; grande, which means medium; and tall, which means nothing at all), the rest of our conversation might as well have been conducted in Esperanto. Did
I want half and half&quot;? Did I want empty space with that&quot;? And, of course, the one that has recently become policy in Britain but has long been routine in the States: Whats your name?&quot;
By this point I was so flustered by trying to work out what to do with my empty space (it is so that you can add your own milk, apparently) that, instead of giving my name, I said, in fluent American, To go, please.&quot; My wife tried to hide her
giggles as the barista dutifully wrote down Togo&quot; on my venti, half-half, empty-space caffeine product.
If there was any justice in the world, coffee chains would have long gone the way of the dodo. No more uncomfortable chairs, meaningless marketing slogans, piped music, annoying wall poetry, overpriced muffins, eager tip bowls, unsubtle upselling,
unreliable Wi-Fi connections, dirty tables, locked lavatories and the pervasive whiff of rancid milk.
And yet they continue to go from strength to strength. A survey published yesterday found that Britons spend at least £15,600 in coffee shops over a lifetime. Last year British coffee shop sales grew by 10 per cent to reach £2.1 billion, twice the
level of 2005. The rest of our economy may not be going great guns, but at least we can maintain a constant state of nervous energy while it flounders around our ears.
Its not going to stop here, either. In February, Starbucks announced a Renaissance&quot; plan  given that it already has 20,000 stores worldwide, I wasnt aware that it needed rebirth. It proposed to focus on adding hundreds more outlets in Europe,
notably in airports, service stations and hotels.
The Onion, an American satirical magazine, had the measure of it when it wrote the spoof headline back in June 1998: New Starbucks opens in rest room of existing Starbucks&quot;.
So why do we do it? Why do we maintain this love/hate  but mainly hate  relationship with Starbucks and its slightly less awful siblings, Caffè Nero and Costa?
There are a few obvious theories: were constantly tired; were addicted to the caffeine; were addicted to the routine. A commute is more bearable if you have a polystyrene comfort blanket. A latte break in the office wont kill you as quickly as a
fag break; indeed, if research is to be believed, moderate coffee consumption reduces the risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimers. If youre out and about, coffee chains offer warmth, familiarity, a cheap meeting room and the chance
to go to the loo. They are marginally preferable to sitting on the pavement or buying your own machine, which costs the same as a small car.
One wonders, though, how much longer this will be the case. Earlier this month Starbucks unveiled a teeth-pulling advertisement in which they seem to be labouring under the delusion that they are a person, not a shop that sells coffee.
Were Starbucks, nice to meet you,&quot; says a chirpy northerner Ive never met. Have you noticed how everything seems a little impersonal nowadays?&quot;
Whereas weve all become user names, reference numbers and IP addresses&quot;, he promises to refer to us as your folks intended: by your name&quot;.
And so, where America leads, Britain follows  with predictably annoying results. I tried it out in London yesterday. The result? Togo&quot; has become Ean&quot;.
No doubt such an approach is intended to improve efficiency and harness brand loyalty. Yet it also achieves the unique feat of making the customer feel that the barista is being both too personal and too impersonal.
Next time that Im asked how I would like my coffee to be served, I am going to request a venti dollop of anonymity.</TEXT>

<TI>Bausch + Lomb to acquire Ista Pharmaceuticals.</TI>
<TEXT>Bausch + Lomb and Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc (Ista) have signed a definitive agreement under which Bausch + Lomb will acquire Ista for $9.10/share in cash, or a total of about $500 M. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the
boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close in 2Q 2012. Bausch + Lomb&apos;s acquisition of Ista accelerates the company&apos;s strategy to strengthen its pipeline and marketed products and capabilities. The transaction is expected to drive growth
and high performance for the long term. The combination adds Ista&apos;s portfolio of industry-proven non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory, allergy, glaucoma and spreading agents to Bausch + Lomb&apos;s robust, complementary portfolio of existing Rx ophthalmology and
OTC eye health products. The companies also have complementary development pipelines.
The transaction, which is expected to be accretive to Bausch + Lomb&apos;s EBITDA in the first year after close, is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, including the approval of Ista&apos;s shareholders. The companies will
continue to operate independently until completion of the transaction. Bausch + Lomb currently intends to finance the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and the proceeds of a $350 M incremental term loan facility to be provided under its
existing credit facility and available borrowings under its existing revolving credit facilities or, alternatively, to obtain other financing in lieu of the foregoing (provided that Bausch + Lomb intends in all cases to have a combination of cash on
hand and committed financing sufficient to finance the acquisition). Bausch + Lomb has obtained commitments for the full amount of the incremental facility from Citigroup Global Markets Inc, JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, Credit Suisse AG, Goldman Sachs Bank
USA, and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. This purchase price reflects a 10% premium to the share price as of the market close on 23 Mar 2012, a 40% premium to the proposal letter Ista publicly confirmed it received from Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a 134%
premium to the share price on 15 Dec 2011, the trading day prior to Ista&apos;s announcement of the proposal letter it received from Valeant Pharmaceuticals and the Ista board&apos;s announcement of its intention to review strategic options. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co
served as financial advisor to Bausch + Lomb in this transaction and Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton LLP served as legal counsel. Greenhill &amp; Co served as financial advisor to Ista and Stradling Yocca Carlson &amp; Rauth and WilmerHale LLP served as legal
advisors. Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc is a fast growing and the third largest branded prescription eye care business in the US with an expanding focus on allergy therapeutics. Bausch + Lomb is one of the best-known and most respected healthcare companies
in the world.

<TI>Diabetes study could create new class of surgical candidates</TI>
<TEXT>A study published by the New England Journal of Medicine could create waves in the type 2 diabetes community. The study, which followed 150 patients with uncontrollable type 2 diabetes, showed gastric bypass may be the best intervention, trumping
medication and sleeve-gastronectomy, which is a variation of gastric bypass.
The results showed the gastric bypass kicked type 2 diabetes into remission and was of particular note because the changeover happened before patients hit their weight goals. Most of the surgery patients also reined in their glucose levels without
medication.
Of added value was that the patient class hovered in the 30-35 BMI range, which is a unique class, because it focuses on a group that is not necessarily the heaviest of heavy-set sufferers.
President of the American Society for Metabolic &amp; Bariatric Surgery Robin Blackstone told MM&amp;M that the results may prompt doctors to discuss surgery with patients sooner. She also said it was important to note that the glucose control occurred
before weight loss. Gastric banding, which restricts the stomach as opposed to rewiring the gastrointestinal track, can ameliorate diabetes, but only after weight loss.
Blackstone noted that the findings show that the surgery isn&apos;t really about obesity anymore. She said that the results essentially create a new type of gastric bypass surgery by converting patients in a BMI range that was previously excluded from
surgical consideration into viable surgical candidates.
They&apos;re not surgical candidates for the treatment of obesity, but they are for the treatment of diabetes.
She said she expects it may take a few years before insurers are persuaded that these patients are indeed surgical candidates, but that doctors may begin discussing the surgery as a treatment option for this discrete set of patients within the
year.
The significance for the overall diabetes community could be substantialthe Centers for Disease Control reports that 90% to 95% of all adult diabetes cases are type 2 diabetes. Predictions are that associated triggers, including a soaring obesity
rate, are going to push the number of type 2 diabetes cases even higher, adding even greater pressure on the direct medical costs$116 billionthe CDC associates with the disease. This is in addition to the $58 billion in indirect costs, such as lost
productivity, the agency links to both forms of diabetes.</TEXT>

<TI>Novo Nordisk/SHB: Victoza kan i værste fald blive forsinket</TI>
<TEXT>Novo Nordisks kommercielle lancering af Victoza i fedmebehandling kan blive forsinket i et par år til 2016 fra 2014. Det vurderer Handelsbanken Capital Markets, efter et ekspertpanel under den amerikanske lægemiddelstyrelse, FDA, torsdag
anbefalede at skærpe kravene til kommende vægttabsmidler. - Hvis FDA vælger at følge det uafhængige panels anbefaling, kan det betyde, at Novo Nordisk kan blive nødt til at gennemføre et yderligere studie, som påviser at Victoza til behandling af fedme
ikke påfører patienter betydelige hjerte-kar problemer. Det kan i værste fald betyde at Victoza til behandling af fedme først bliver kommercielt lanceret to år senere end planlagt. Det er dog endnu for tildigt at sige, at dette bliver udfaldet,
konstaterer banken i sin morgenkommentar. Også Jyske Bank og Nordea vurderer, at Victozas lancering som fedmebehandlingsmiddel kan forsinkes i to til tre år. Handelsbanken fastholder anbefalingen &quot;akkumuler&quot; med et kursmål på 909 kr.
Banken har ikke indregnet værdi af Victoza til behandling af fedme i sine nuværende modeller. - Vi venter dog, at Novo-aktien kan komme under pres på helt kort sigt indtil der er mere klarhed om hvorvidt FDA vil kræve yderligere studier for
Victoza til behandling af fedme. Men fundamentalt set er der efter vores vurdering intet ændret i Novo-casen og vurderer at et tilbagefald vil være en god opkøbsmulighed, skriver Handelsbanken. FDA-eksperterne anbefalede torsdag aften med stemmerne 17-6
at gennemføre hjerte-kar-studier, selv hvis der ikke er synlige tegn på, at stoffet øger risikoen for hjerte-kar-sygdomme. Panelet anbefalede samtidig at inkludere endnu flere patienter i risikogruppen i studierne, det vil sige patienter, der lider af
svær fedme og ældre og endnu sygere patienter. FDA følger normalt indstillingerne fra ekspertpanelerne, men har det endelige ord i forhold til at udvikle de nye retningslinjer for fedmemedicin. Jakob Dalskov +45 33 30 03 35 Ritzau Finans,

<TI>Expect Crude to trade with a sideways bias today: Angel</TI>
<TEXT>Angel Commodities has come out with its report on metals and energy. According to the research firm, crude oil prices are expected to trade with a sideways bias today taking cues from expectations of strategic crude oil reserves release from the
Western Nations.
Nymex crude oil prices declined by 2.5 percent yesterday the biggest decline in this year taking cues from French Prime Minister Mr. Francois Fillon statement that prospectus are looking good for US-Europe agreement for a release of strategic
crude oil reserves coupled with International Energy Agency said that they are ready to release the reserves if supply is disrupted.
Additionally, US President Mr. Barack Obama called a meeting to end subsidies worth $ 4 billion for oil and natural gas companies and divert that money towards clean energy fuels. Oil prices touched an intra-day low of $ /bbl and closed at $ /bbl
in yesterday&apos;s trading session. On the MCX, prices declined around 2 percent and closed at Rs.5293/bbl after touching an intra-day low of Rs.5271/bbl on Thursday.
News: US representatives Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat and Robert Dold, an Illinois Republican, introduced the Iran Energy Sector and Proliferation Sanctions Act in Congress meeting yesterday. This latest measure is taken to speed up the campaign
of tightening sanctions on Iran. In response to sanctions, Iran the second biggest producer in Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has raised supply concern by threatening to shut the Strait of Hormuz which supplies fifth of world&apos;s crude
oil.
Natural Gas: Nymex natural gas prices declined around 4.3 percent yesterday on the back of more than expected rise in US natural gas inventories. Gas prices touched an intra-day low of $ 2.132/mmbtu and closed at $ 2.17/mmbtu in yesterday&apos;s
trading session.
EIA Inventories: US Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its weekly inventories yesterday and US natural gas inventory has increased more than expected by 57 billion cubic feet (bcf) to 2.437 trillion cubic feet for the week ending on
23rd March 2012.
Outlook: We expect crude oil prices to trade with a sideways bias today taking cues from expectations of strategic crude oil reserves release from the Western Nations. However, supply worries from Iran may provide some support to oil prices.
Natural gas prices are also expected to trade with a negative bias today.

<TI>Man, 76, survives 10 days in the desert using &apos;Boy Scout&apos; skills; A 76-year-old diabetic man survived 10 days in the remote Nevada desert by melting snow and using skills he learned as a Boy Scout, but a friend who was with him and ventured away
to get help died.</TI>
<TEXT>James Klemovich and Laszlo Szabo, 75, went to scope out some mines in the state when their car became stuck on a lonely road with no cell phone service, Klemovich&apos;s wife, Joanne, said on Thursday.
The men tried unsuccessfully to dislodge the car, and lit flares and started fires in hopes somebody would see them in northwestern Nevada&apos;s Pershing County, an area where less than 7,000 people are spread over 6,000 square miles.
They used a towel in the car to strain ditch water and snow into water bottles, but, after four or five days, Szabo left to get help. Joanne Klemovich began to worry when several days passed without a phone call from her husband.
&quot;I figured maybe they&apos;d had an accident and they were stranded,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought maybe they were in a mine shaft. All kinds of things were going through my head.&quot;
Joanne Klemovich said she was expecting the worst when authorities called on Tuesday night to say her husband had been found by military personnel who were holding training exercises in the area.
&quot;I thought it was bad news, but it was very good news,&quot; she said by telephone from the couple&apos;s home in Littleton, Colorado,
. &quot;I didn&apos;t know what to even do or say.&quot;
James Klemovich has diabetes, wears a pacemaker and had a triple bypass heart surgery, his wife said.
He told her he wasn&apos;t panicking while he sat for days waiting for Szabo&apos;s return, she said. He kept a journal, noting how much water he drank and what he did each day. And he wrote a letter each day for her.
Drinking regularly was likely the biggest factor in his survival despite the diabetes that could have sent his blood sugar dangerously out of whack, according to Rita Kalyani, who teaches endocrinology at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore.
During a fast, she said, the body can draw glucose from the liver or from fat stores to keep levels from dropping too low. But having enough water is essential to flush out excess glucose and prevent levels from rising too high.
When the military personnel found Klemovich, they gave him a banana, two oranges and three boiled eggs, he told his wife.
Szabo, of Lovelock, Nevada, was found dead about a mile and a half away . An autopsy is being performed.
Klemovich said her husband hasn&apos;t been talking much about his friend and that she doesn&apos;t know whether Szabo has any close relatives.
&quot;When I first talked to him I could tell he&apos;d been through an ordeal,&quot; she said. &quot;When he called back, he sounded pretty good.&quot;
James Klemovich is still in Nevada, waiting for the car to be recovered before returning home. He was treated and released from a hospital.

<TI>Local veteran wants benefits \ VETERANS AFFAIRS</TI>
<TEXT>WOODSTOCK-He fought for the Allies in the Korean War and worries he&apos;ll spend the rest of what he has left of his life fighting for benefits he thinks he deserves.
On the same day he was released from hospital after suffering his second heart attack, Woodstock resident John Wood expressed outrage over his ineligibility to receive help from Veterans Affairs Canada.
When released, his doctor didn&apos;t waste time mixing words.
&quot;My doc says this is the last one I&apos;ll have because the damage is too severe. If I have another one, I&apos;m dead,&quot; he said.
Wood is a longtime sufferer of diabetes, so much so that kidney disease has developed and he&apos;s lost most of his eyesight. He also experiences severe arthritis in his knees and joints, and is currently on oxygen.
Over the past few years, as his health has deteriorated, the 77-year-old has called Veterans Affairs several times pleading for help. But each time, he has been told the same thing. No help is coming because he and his wife Margaret, 73, earn too
much money.
&quot;I don&apos;t really have that much money. What I&apos;m afraid of is we&apos;ll spend everything trying to keep me going, and when I go, they&apos;ll be hardly anything left for her,&quot; he said.
Between his pension from Alexandra hospital, her pension from her work as a bookkeeper and their government pensions, the couple makes more than the $2,000 a month, making them ineligible for Allied Veterans benefi ts.
&quot;I don&apos;t make over the amount, but with my wife&apos;s pension, we do. But I want to know why they are taking away money from my wife. I was the one that fought in Korea -not my wife,&quot; he said. &quot;I just want some help, that&apos;s what I fought for. What the
hell are we fighting for if we can&apos;t get help when we&apos;re older.&quot;
Wood, who was born in Halifax, England, served the last two years of the Korean War in high combat zones. He was hospitalized when his eardrums were punctured and still suffers from hearing loss.
He moved to Canada shortly after the war in 1956. Margaret moved over from England a year later and the couple was married.
&quot;I&apos;ve done everything all these years. I&apos;ve worked, paid all my taxes and I&apos;ve saved a little bit of money. It just feels like I&apos;m being penalized. I don&apos;t want money. I want someone to help us around the house, do some light cleaning, cut the
grass and shovel the driveway. My wife has a terrible back and I just can&apos;t do much anymore,&quot; he said.
Wood said there have been agencies that have stepped up to help. An employee from Community Care Access Centre comes in each morning to help Wood get washed and dressed for the day. A member of the Red Cross comes and sits with him for two hours
once a week so his wife can go have a coffee and relax. And his 53-year-old son and his wife help around the house as much as they can.
&quot;I just don&apos;t want to be a burden for all of them. I think Veterans Affairs can help me. They should help me. I helped when I was needed and now I need help,&quot; he said.
Although Simon Forsyth, a media relations officer for Veterans Affairs, could not comment on Wood and his troubles, he did issue some background on the offering of Allied benefits.
It wasn&apos;t until January 2010 that the federal government began offering some benefits to low-income Allied veterans who served in the Korean War.
At the same time, the government restored benefits, after a 15-year hiatus, to Second World War Allied veterans residing in Canada, including the War Veterans Allowance, the Funeral and Burial Assistance Program, the Veterans Independence Program
and long-term care.
Benefits are not eligible to those who file income taxes as a single and make more than $1,381.56 or $2,095.33 if they are married.
&quot;A top priority at Veterans Affairs Canada is making sure that veterans and their families have the support they need, when they need it,&quot; he said in an e-mail.

<TI>Mother knows best at Hatton; Donation pays for Southington school&apos;s new play equipment</TI>
<TEXT>SOUTHINGTON - Hatton School has a new addition to its playground. Thanks to a donation from the parent of a student, new parallel bars, a climbing pole, an incline slide and over-under bars will be used by the kindergarten-through-fifth-grade
students there.
More than $7,000 worth of equipment has been installed next to the playscape. Wednesday, fifth-graders and their physical education teacher, Marcia Phelps, tried out the new equipment, with Phelps offering tips on appropriate use.
&quot;Kids don&apos;t climb trees anymore,&quot; Phelps said. &quot;This equipment is designed to improve upper body strength.&quot;
Children ran back and forth among the pieces of equipment. After Phelps would demonstrate an exercise, students would imitate her. They attempted to pull themselves up the climbing poles. On the parallel bars, students lifted themselves and spun
around. Many swung from bars and tried to do chin-ups.
&quot;One of the biggest issues today is childhood obesity,&quot; Phelps said. &quot;As a way to combat that, this equipment was purchased.&quot;
Marissa Salsbury, mother of fifthgrader Ethan Salsbury, was the donor. After the equipment was bought and installed and the ground mulched, she donated $10,000.
&quot;My father always gave back and I wanted to do the same thing,&quot; Salsbury said.
Salsbury is a member of the school&apos;s Parent-Teacher Organization, and said that, while she and others always work hard to raise funds and get people to help, little money comes in. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to do anything,&quot; she said. &quot;I decided to do it
myself.&quot;
With society focusing on fitness, Salsbury thought it would be a great idea to buy equipment that provides children with safe, athletic fun.
&quot;The equipment is going to be there for years to come,&quot; she said. &quot;Kids can play on it during school and after school on the weekends.&quot;
Salsbury also kept physically handicapped children in mind when deciding what equipment to buy. Those children can use the equipment to build strength, she said.
Salsbuy said she and Hatton Principal Roberta McAloon had discussed installing a rock climbing wall, but decided that students would get more use from outdoor equipment.
McAloon said Salsbury&apos;s decision to make a donation was a wonderful surprise.
&quot;We took the time and went through the catalogs to figure out what was the most fitting for the school,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s a great addition. It fits in nicely with our physical fitness curriculum.&quot;
Phelps said the equipment is much different from typical playground structures.
&quot;These are like fitness stations,&quot; Phelps said. Once students become familiar with the equipment, Phelps said she&apos;ll develop challenges for them.
Ethan Salsbury was among the students using the equipment Wednesday afternoon.
&quot;I think it&apos;s good,&quot; Ethan said. &quot;We&apos;ll have more fun at recess.&quot;
Ethan said his favorite new piece of equipment is the climbing pole.
&quot;It&apos;s fun, you can climb up and slide back down easily,&quot; he said.

<TI>Can diet changes ease chronic inflammation?</TI>
<TEXT>Q. Can my diet contribute to chronic inflammation?
A. The foods you are eating may be the root of some major health problems and even contribute to your achy joints. How many of these foods end up on your plate each day?
Saturated fats, which are found in animal products like meats and dairy.
Trans-fats, which can be found in processed foods, baked goods and some oils.
Sugar: Yes, table sugar is important to avoid, but added sugar is the real culprit.
Refined carbohydrates, which are made with processed, white flour and contain little to no fiber.
Here are some healthy upgrades:
Choose low-fat dairy products and lean meats.
Minimize processed foods.
Eat fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
Hungry? Here are some foods that may help reduce chronic inflammation:
Foods that are rich in omega-3 are key. Try salmon, ahi tuna, sardines, nuts and seeds like flax, chia and hemp.
Olive oil, onion, turmeric, garlic and ginger have chemicals that act as a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory.
Berries, as well as deep red and purple fruits, are loaded with antioxidants and free radical-fighting properties that can aid in the prevention of chronic inflammation.
Broccoli, asparagus, carrots and many other deep orange and dark green vegetables are loaded with phyto-nutrients to prevent inflammation.
All types of tea have anti-inflammatory properties.

<TI>Affymax Inc, MAP Pharmaceuticals Inc drug approvals would net royalty bounty for Nektar Therapeutics.</TI>
<TEXT>San Francisco-based Nektar Therapeutics (Nektar) is in line for royalty payments if the Food and Drug Administration approves an acute migraine drug from MAP Pharmaceuticals Inc (MAP) and partner Allergan Inc. It would collect more royalties if an
anaemia drug from Affymax Inc and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd is approved. Both drugs use know-how developed by and licensed from Nektar. Signed within months of each other in 2002, the licensing deals are typical of the pacts made between drug
developers: company A with a technology meets company B with a drug, they decide there&apos;s a match and they consummate the relationship, legally speaking. Often in these long-term affairs, however, one or both partners die along the way and the booty is
captured by one of their descendants. But the MAP and Affymax deals with Nektar have the potential to write rare happy endings, with three Bay Area companies and with the drug approvals coming a day apart.
Analysts peg peak sales of Levadex from Mountain View-based MAP at $400 M to $500 M. Peginesatide from Palo Alto-based Affymax could garner revenue in the neighbourhood of $350 M to $550 M. In the end, that could translate into a good deal of coin
for Nektar. Its royalties for Levadex and peginesatide are believed to be in the mid-single digits. Nektar in Feb 2012 sold the potential royalty revenue from Mircera and Cimzia to a unit of Royalty Pharma for $124 M. Nektar said it would use the
Royalty Pharma bounty to pay down a convertible note that is due in Sep 2012 - and it said it was mulling the sale of other royalty interests as well.

<TI>enXco acquires Texas wind development assets from Element Power.</TI>
<TEXT>enXco and Element Power US LLC (Element Power) have announced that enXco has closed on the purchase of the Bobcat Bluff Wind Project. The project, which spans about 14,000 contiguous acres, is located about 20 miles south of Wichita Falls in
Archer County, TX. Shortly, enXco intends to deploy up to 150 MW of GE 1.5 sle turbines. Construction is expected begin in spring of 2012 with an operational date set for Dec 2012. This transaction provides enXco with an opportunity to enter the strong
wind resource market of the Energy Reliability Council of Texas while the federal Production Tax Credit programme is in effect. By working with Element Power, enXco can leverage its collective experience and resources to complete projects within the Dec
2012 timeframe. Bobcat Bluff marks enXco&apos;s second development acquisition within Texas in 1Q 2012. Both projects are scheduled for construction and completion in 2012.
Bobcat Bluff not only offers value to Element Power and enXco, but will also create local jobs and inject capital into the community via lease payments to landowners and payments to Archer County and Archer City ISD. enXco develops, constructs,
owns, operates and manages renewable energy projects throughout the US. Element Power was established in 2008 with leading industry professionals to develop, finance, construct and operate renewable energy projects globally.

<TI>CLOSE TO HOME: STICKING WITH PLAZA PLAN IS SMART</TI>
<TEXT>Changes are happening rapidly now that redevelopment agencies statewide in California have been dissolved.
Sonoma County&apos;s oversight board this week supported the continuation of the Roseland Plaza project on Sebastopol Road in Santa Rosa. The board&apos;s decision will be reviewed by the state Department of Finance, which will have the final say on which
projects continue and which properties are liquidated.
In terms of the Roseland Plaza, the oversight board determined that it is more valuable to collect taxes on the businesses around a newly created plaza in the future than to sell off the property now. The plaza is the heart of a vision plan for
the Sebastopol Road corridor and the Roseland Village Shopping Center in particular.
There are a lot of people who care deeply about the plaza, beginning with Roseland residents who long for a public square to make it easy to socialize, shop and celebrate as a community. Think of the impact that having a Town Green has made to
Windsor. To realize this vision, finding new partners to offset the loss of Redevelopment funds is critical.
Interestingly, there are other entities that have a stake in seeing Roseland develop in a walkable fashion. One is Plan Bay Area and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. Sebastopol Road has been designated as a &quot;priority development area&quot;
to reduce greenhouse gases. These represent neighborhoods where there is local commitment to develop housing along with amenities and services to meet day-to-day needs of residents in a walkable environment served by transit.MTC can help fund
transportation related projects in Roseland.
Another stakeholder is Sonoma County&apos;s health department. Using a variety of health-related grant funding, more than $1 million has been spent by the health department on the Roseland and Kawana Springs areas to stem the tide of obesity and its
related chronic diseases. A survey done in 2007 reported that 65 percent of the population in south Santa Rosa is overweight or obese.
The rise in obesity in the United States correlates with decades of development patterns that have made walking and bicycling difficult or impossible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the direct medical costs of
physical inactivity totaled more than $76 billion in 2000.
If departments such as health, human services and planning and the city of Santa Rosa were to seek innovative ways to apply for community health-related grants or identify creative financing strategies, they could build on all the work that has
been accomplished to date. These planning efforts could extend the walkable benefits of the plaza to a larger area.
A specific plan would rezone the area within a quarter-mile of the new plaza as well as the other neighborhoods along the Sebastopol Road corridor. This type of zoning adds street connections and compels interesting building fronts behind
sidewalks. This makes it safe and enjoyable for residents to walk to transit stops.
Given that the benefits of continuing with the Roseland Plaza project are economic, social, environmental and health-related for the Roseland Community, it is wonderful that the oversight board has recommended that the Roseland Plaza project be
continued. Providing that the state Department of Finance retains this project, the next step would be for the oversight board and county supervisors to direct that a newly focused collaborative effort between health, planning, social services and MTC
be undertaken to apply for planning or development grants.

<TI>Australia&apos;s Tony Abbott &apos;regrets&apos; derogatory remarks about Julia Gillard; Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott back-pedalled on Friday after derogatory comments about the clothes and appearance of Julia Gillard, the country&apos;s first female
prime minister.</TI>
<TEXT>The furore began when well-known &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/&quot;&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt;
feminist Germaine Greer told ABC television that Gillard wore unflattering jackets and had a &quot;big a-se&quot;.
&quot;Every time she turns round, you&apos;ve got that strange horizontal crease, which means they&apos;re cut too narrow in the hips,&quot; Greer said.
&quot;You&apos;ve got a big a-se, Julia. Just get on with it.&quot;
While meeting the public at a community forum on Thursday the issue came up and Mr Abbott responded: &quot;I know, I know, I know. Germaine Greer was right on that subject.&quot;
On Friday he said he regretted the remark after it was widely played on television.
&quot;It was an off-the-cuff remark responding to an observation of a member of the public and I shouldn&apos;t have said it and I regret it,&quot; he said.
Miss Gillard is Australia&apos;s first female leader and her boyfriend Tim Mathieson has previously hit out at people &quot;bullying&quot; her.
&quot;Being a woman, I think she&apos;s gets targeted quite a bit by the big boys in town,&quot; he said at the time.
&quot;Bullying women just doesn&apos;t work for me ... calling females names does not get you anywhere,&quot; he added.

<TI>MOgene LC, a NimbleGen service provider, signs agreement with Lawrence Livermore National Lab to offer microbial detection array services.</TI>
<TEXT>MOgene LC has announced the signing of an agreement with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to provide services using the Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array (LLMDA). The technology of the LLMDA, which includes probes for more
than 3000 bacterial and viral species, has been optimised for NimbleGen arrays. The Livermore-developed array provides rapid and comprehensive analysis of bacteria or viruses from biological material of unknown nature. This capability has been shown to
be very useful in food and pharmaceutical safety, detection of viral and bacterial infections, and animal health, as well as many other applications. MOgene signed an agreement with LLNL for the potential it offers to its existing customers and because
it allows the company to expand into new areas for our microarray and sequencing service business.
The LLMDA could enable food safety professionals, law enforcement, medical professionals and others to detect within 24 hours any virus or bacteria that has been sequenced and included among the array&apos;s probes. It detects viruses and bacteria with
the use of 388,000 probes that fit in a checkerboard pattern in the middle of a one-inch wide, three-inch long glass slide. One advantage of the LLMDA is that it provides researchers with the capability of detecting pathogens over the entire range of
known viruses and bacteria. Current multiplex polymerase chain reaction techniques can at most offer detection from among 50 organisms in one test. MOgene has been in the genomics service business since 2004 and has worked with many pharmaceutical and
agricultural businesses, along with universities, around the world. MOgene LC is a leading global genomics service provider located in St Louis, MO. MOgene.

<TI>&apos;Abbott needs personal politics lesson&apos;</TI>
<TEXT>OPPOSITION Leader Tony Abbott has again shown he needs a lesson in &quot;personal politics 101&quot; after making inappropriate remarks for a second time in a week, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon says.
Mr Abbott said he regretted a remark he made in reference to Prime Minister Julia Gillard&apos;s wardrobe and appearance.
Feminist Germaine Greer started the furore after she told an ABC TV panel that Ms Gillard wore unflattering jackets and had a &quot;big arse&quot;.
A woman speaking to Mr Abbott at a community forum in Victoria yesterday raised the subject again saying:
&quot;Get some of those jackets off her&quot; and he replied: &quot;I know, I know, I know. Germaine Greer was right on that subject.&quot;
Mr Abbott said he regretted the remark when quizzed on the Channel 9 today.
&quot;It was an off-the-cuff remark responding to an observation of a member of the public and I shouldn&apos;t have said it and I regret it,&quot; he said.
The latest verbal gaffe came just a week after Mr Abbott apologised in parliament for inappropriately saying Ms Gillard and the leader of the House of Representatives, Anthony Albanese, were &quot;walking around with targets on their foreheads&quot;.
Ms Roxon reminded reporters on Friday that Mr Abbott had abused Bernie Banton when he was dying from asbestos-induced fibrosis, and had &quot;happily&quot; swore at her (Ms Roxon) after a debate at the National Press Club.
&quot;This is Mr Abbott losing control and perhaps being under more pressure than he has been under in a while,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I also think this is Mr Abbott who needs a lesson on personal politics 101 which is, if your wife or girlfriend says, &apos;Does my bum look big in this?&apos; you say, &apos;No&apos; and get on with it.&quot;
She didn&apos;t think it was appropriate for anyone to comment on the prime minister&apos;s clothing, including Ms Greer.
&quot;Germaine Greer really didn&apos;t do herself proud in making those comments,&quot; she said.
Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten agreed, saying it was a case of an iconic feminist having a crack at another successful woman.
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have said what Tony Abbott said, it was just ridiculous,&quot; Mr Shorten told Channel 7.
Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey told the same program it was a &quot;no-go area&quot; for any male to talk about female clothing.
But he told Fairfax radio that the way one dresses and presents themselves does matter because it forms part of the judgment made of an individual.
&quot;For example, I can say to you, with absolute confidence, that you&apos;re unlikely to see me in Speedos,&quot; he said.
But he said both Ms Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan had said some &quot;nasty things&quot; about him in the past.
&quot;For me it&apos;s water off a duck&apos;s back. It&apos;s no revelation that I&apos;m a fully sized guy,&quot; he said.
&quot;Frankly when you pass comment about someone&apos;s weight or something like that I think it says more about you than it does about them.&quot;</TEXT>

<TI>Davies and Partners Solicitors Medical Negligence Specialists; ADVERTISEMENT</TI>
<TEXT>&quot; In general the hospital care we receive in the UK is excellent and most surgery is completely successful. However, there are occasions when things do go wrong and this is when you would require the help of specialist lawyers to help you pursue a
medical negligence claim. Davies and Partners Solicitors has one of the largest Medical Negligence teams in the UK. All our solicitors are experts in their field including five members of the Law Society Accreditation Scheme and three members of the
AvMA specialists panel.
We offer comprehensive advice and expertise in all areas of medical negligence and have received notable acclaim for our achievements in the highly complex area of catastrophic injury arising from birth or other trauma. The firm holds a clinical
negligence franchise enabling us to offer Legal Aid work.
We provide a quality service for many successful claimants every year and we have recovered millions of pounds of compensation on behalf of clients. If you need any advice and a no obligation discussion about your particular case, then please
contact our Ewan Lockhart Partner &amp; Head of Clinical Negligence &amp; Personal Injury team.&quot;
Our areas of expertise Davies and Partners Solicitors has one of the largest Medical Negligence teams in the South West focusing on all areas of medical and clinical practice including: ¦ Medical, dental or plastic surgery ¦ Neurology ¦
Orthopaedics ¦ Obstetrics ¦ Gynaecology ¦ Catastrophic injury ¦ Inquests CASE STUDY Death from pressure sores Davies and Partners settled a clinical negligence claim for a client whose wife died as a result of severe pressure sores which developed while
she was an in patient at St Michael&apos;s hospital in Bristol. The 64 year old lady was a newly-diagnosed diabetic who failed to recover as expected from a hysterectomy. At a 4 day inquest hospital staff admitted failing to follow national and Trust
guidelines on nursing care aimed at preventing and managing pressure sores. The Deputy Coroner for Avon, nonetheless, returned a verdict setting out the circumstances of her death and stating that this occurred despite a satisfactory level of care.
Following the inquest Davies and Partners sent a lengthy pre-action letter of claim to University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, coupled with a settlement offer.
Lawyers at the NHS Litigation Authority took a different view from the Deputy Coroner and agreed to pay damages and costs, including the costs of representation at the inquest.
CASE STUDY Failure to diagnose and treat fatal DVT Davies and Partners acted for a widower Mr A, whose wife died following a GPs failure to examine and identify a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which resulted in his wife having a fatal pulmonary
embolism.
Mrs A had flown back to the UK following a period overseas. On her return she became concerned about a swelling in her left ankle. Over the next few weeks she attended the GP surgery on three separate occasions as the swelling in her ankle
continued and had spread to her leg. During these three visits she saw two different GPs. The first recorded that clinically there was no sign of DVT, but referred Mrs A for an urgent abdominal ultrasound scan. The second GP, recorded that there was
left ankle swelling and slight pain but concluded that there was no DVT and prescribed Frusemide. Two days later Mrs A collapsed and was taken to hospital. Resuscitation was unsuccessful and she died due to a pulmonary embolism arising from the DVT in
the left leg.
Mrs A&apos;s husband brought a case against the first GP based on his negligence in failing to obtain a full history from his wife on her first visit including failing to ask about recent foreign travel; he had also failed to undertake an adequate
examination and to consider Mrs A&apos;s continued condition on subsequent visits.
If Mrs A had been admitted to hospital for the relevant scans and appropriate treatment following any of her visits to the surgery or she had been provided with anti-coagulant drugs, the fatal pulmonary embolism would have been avoided. After a
period of negotiation a settlement was agreed and approved by the Court in the global sum of £77,500.
CASE STUDY Case against North Bristol NHS Trust Davies and Partners acted for M in respect of a claim arising out of her husband&apos;s death. In 2007, the deceased developed chest pain whilst in Southmead Hospital for a hip replacement operation. He
underwent an angioplasty but was not administered heparin during the procedure. Postoperatively, he developed a blood clot and died from a myocardial infarction. An inquest was held to determine the cause of death and prior to the Inquest, the Trust
admitted the failure to administer Heparin was negligent. The inquest confirmed that the failure to administer heparin was the cause of death and following this, settlement negotiations took place with the Trust. M received the sum of £95,500.
In a recent client survey 100% of clients would recommend Davies and Partners Clinical Negligence team in Bristol.
FEEDBACK FROM OUR CLIENTS &quot; Very professional genuine company.

<TI>&apos;WHAT DOESN&apos;T KILL YOU MAKES YOU; STRONGER&apos;; Two county students TO SERVE as representatives for Hurley Benefit Ball</TI>
<TEXT>By Sarah Schuch
Credit: sschuch@mlive.com
GENESEE COUNTY -- One is a Kearsley High School student, the other a Flint International Academy seventh-grader, but one thing they have in common is they both have had to fight for a normal life.
Austin Perez, 16, of Genesee Township, has struggled with severe asthma most of his life. April LaGrone, 12, of Flint, has been learning how to balance life with Type I juvenile diabetes since 2006.
Because of their stories, their time spent in Hurley Medical Center&apos;s pediatric department and their support and promotion of the Children&apos;s Miracle Network and Hurley&apos;s Children Hospital, Austin and April are being recognized at this year&apos;s
See Hurley, A2
Continued from A1
Hurley Benefit Ball, which raises money for the children&apos;s hospital.
&quot;It&apos;s a proud moment. You just know you&apos;ve come through so much,&quot; Austin said in an interview with The Flint Journal. &quot;I think it makes you a stronger person. ... Some people don&apos;t truly understand what (asthma) does, how it changes your life.&quot;
Austin was born with underdeveloped lungs. For more than a year, he was treated for upper respiratory infections, one after the other, before he was diagnosed with having asthma at age 3.
It was hard for him to breathe, making it difficult for him to do much of anything else, including walk, play outside or even tie his shoes. During his first time sledding at age 5, he collapsed at the bottom of the hill and had to be rushed to
the hospital.
From age 6 to 10, Austin&apos;s asthma was at its worst. He was on 11 medications. Between October and March, it was almost a guarantee that he would be in the hospital regularly. Two attacks were so bad Austin almost died.
He spent most of his time inside, away from anything that could create an attack.
&quot;I pretty much lived in the hospital. I had someone doing everything for me, carrying me. ... In some way, I feel like I missed out on childhood a little,&quot; Austin said. &quot;It kind of just made you feel bad. ... Why me? You felt left behind that you
couldn&apos;t do what the other kids could do.&quot;
Susan Perez, Austin&apos;s mother, said it was a scary time for the family. Just walking out into the cold could send Austin into an attack.
He and his family were given guidance and education on how to control and deal with his asthma. At age 10, Austin found a medication to help with allergies and asthma. It dramatically reduced his symptoms. In fact, he can&apos;t remember the last time
he&apos;s been to the hospital past age 10.
But the journey has left him a different person, his mother said.
&quot;I was afraid to let him out of the house,&quot; said Perez, adding how proud she was of how he handled it all. &quot;(The whole experience) made him a really responsible kid. It made him grow up fast.&quot;
Now he gets a shot at a normal life, Austin said.
&quot;It&apos;s amazing. I&apos;ve tried new things, got to try new sports,&quot; he said, thanking the staff at Hurley for all their help and support. &quot;Now I&apos;ve got my goals on what I&apos;m going to achieve. I can do anything and it&apos;s awesome.&quot;
Austin and April were chosen to be representatives at the upcoming ball by various clinical staff at Hurley, said Hurley Spokeswoman Ilene Cantor. And they are proud to have them tell their stories and offer inspiration to others, she said.
Dealing with diabetes
April&apos;s story started around Christmas 2006. She was 8 and had symptoms of what she thought was the flu -- fatigue, weight loss, frequent urination and a constant thirst.
Within a month, April had lost 5 to 7 pounds, and she went to see a doctor. Her blood sugar level was so high it didn&apos;t even register in blood tests.
She was diagnosed with a disease that would stick with her for the rest of her life -- Type I juvenile diabetes, a disease in which the body does not properly produce insulin. She spent the next three days in Hurley&apos;s Pediatric Intensive Care Unit
and two more in the pediatric area there.
&quot;I was feeling horrible. I didn&apos;t know what was going on. ... I couldn&apos;t get over it,&quot; said April, who is now in the homebound program at Flint International Academy. &quot;I felt overwhelmed because I was 8 years old. I wanted to be carefree, and now
I had all this responsibility of dealing with this disease.&quot;
Her life would never be the same.
April now checks her blood sugar four to six times a day and gives herself insulin at least four times a day or uses an insulin pump. She had trained herself to count carbohydrates and be careful of everything she eats. Eating sweets in moderation
is particularly important.
Too much physical activity can be dangerous for her blood sugar, as well.
Her blood sugar fluctuates constantly. She never knows when it&apos;s going to be too high or too low. Twice she has gone into diabetic ketoacidosis, when she had too much acid in her blood and had to be rushed to the hospital.
&quot;When I have high blood sugar, I&apos;m tired, thirsty, irritated. (Diabetic ketoacidosis) is like that times 10. My heart beats really fast. Sometimes I vomit, have rapid breathing, burning sensation in my chest,&quot; April said.
&quot;It was the worst feeling in the world. I thought I was going to die. I thought I would never feel normal again. It&apos;s hard to feel normal when you have diabetes. It&apos;s up and down. It&apos;s a roller coaster.&quot;
Tonya LaGrone, April&apos;s mother, said it has been difficult to watch her daughter go through so much, but she is proud of how she&apos;s handled it.
&quot;Despite all her challenges, she&apos;s been courageous. She&apos;s a fighter,&quot; LaGrone said. &quot;She still likes to project that she&apos;s a normal teenager.&quot;
April said she has grown through the experience and hopes she can help others in the same situation.
She&apos;s proud to represent the children&apos;s hospital at the upcoming ball, she said.
&quot;I&apos;ve had to grow up really fast. I have all of these responsibilities of how to take care of myself,&quot; April said. &quot;No kid wants to be diagnosed with a disease they will have for the rest of their life. But it could be worse. ... (I want kids with
diabetes to know) you can get through this. I thought it was the end of the world. But you can get through this.
&quot;What doesn&apos;t kill you makes you stronger.&quot;</TEXT>

<TI>UPDATE: Roche Lifts Hostile Illumina Cash Offer to $51 Per Share</TI>
<TEXT>-- New offer values Illumina at around $6.6 billion
-- Illumina tells its shareholders to defer action
-- Analysts say Roche&apos;s new bid could bring a deal closer
-- Offer expires on April 20, two days after Illumina&apos;s AGM
(Adds Illumina&apos;s comment in paragraph 4, details from Roche&apos;s statement, analysts comments and background)
By Marta Falconi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
ZURICH -(Dow Jones)- Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX) Thursday increased its unsolicited offer to buy U.S. gene-sequencing company Illumina Inc. (ILMN) to $51 per share, valuing the company at more than $6.5 billion.
The Swiss drug maker raised its offer from $44.50, saying that based on discussions with Illumina shareholders &quot;we have seen interest to accelerate the takeover process.&quot;
&quot;All other terms and conditions of the tender offer remain unchanged,&quot; Roche said in a statement.
Illumina responded by saying its shareholders should &quot;take no action at this time.&quot;
Roche original $5.7 billion offer for the San Diego-based company, made in January, met fierce resistance from the target company which rejected it as being too low.
In a letter to Illumina Chief Executive Jay Flatley on Thursday, Roche Chairman Franz Humer said the Swiss drug maker wants a negotiated transaction with Illumina, but added: If you continue to decline to negotiate with us, we will have no choice
but to continue our effort to effect a transaction unilaterally.
&quot;We hope that you will agree that our new price presents a very attractive opportunity to your shareholders,&quot; Humer added.
Analysts said Roche&apos;s sweetened offer had been expected, adding that it reflects Illumina&apos;s current share price level and thus may bring an agreed deal closer.
&quot;Roche talked to some shareholders and sees a possibility that there&apos;s interest in the offer at this price,&quot; said David Kaegi, a Zurich-based analyst with Bank Sarasin, who has a buy rating on Roche. Kaegi said Thursday&apos;s move is consistent with
Roche&apos;s past M&amp;A strategy and the company&apos;s history of long and bumpy takeover battles.
&quot;To offer something about 20% lower than what you finally want to pay follows a script in these types of transactions,&quot; he said.
Roche has been increasing pressure on Illumina&apos;s management to give in, extending the offer&apos;s acceptance period twice, after it launched its bid last January. It now runs to 6 p.m. New York time, or 2200 GMT, on April 20 -- two days after
Illumina&apos;s shareholder AGM at which Roche is aiming to gain control of the Illumina board.
Roche said earlier this month that it is also willing to consider &quot;other options,&quot; should the deal fail over price.
Friday&apos;s new bid represents a 15% premium to Roche&apos;s initial offer of $44.50 per share and about 88% over Illumina&apos;s stock price mid-December before rumors of the potential transaction first surfaced.
&quot;The sweetened terms represent a total value of $6.6 billion, and we estimate the value Illumina&apos;s business on a stand alone business to be around $43-$44 per share,&quot; says analyst Andrew Weiss with Swiss private bank Vontobel, which has a buy rate
on Roche. &quot;Hence, it is paying about a $1 billion premium, though we believe Illumina is a great fit for Roche and could enable them to develop more targeted therapies in the future,&quot; he said.
The acquisition of Illumina, which makes gene-decoding machines, is a crucial step for Roche on the path to develop targeted therapies, matching drugs to those patients who benefit most from them and helping curb health care costs. Personalized
medicine is expected to play an increasingly important role in cancer therapy, where Roche is a market leader.

<TI>Tigers&apos; 2008 Final Four banner tucked away in R.C. Johnson&apos;s closet</TI>
<TEXT>March 30--Banished from the FedExForum rafters in controversy, the banner commemorating the University of Memphis&apos; 2008 Final Four run now rests in a less glamorous place: a storage closet in athletic director R.C. Johnson&apos;s office.
&quot;This closet, it has one key to it,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;and I have the key.&quot;
Such is the peculiar status of the highest-profile memento of the Tigers&apos; modern-day pinnacle. Earned from their 38-win season in 2007-08 that ended a Mario Chalmers 3-pointer shy of the national title, the banner hung for two seasons in
FedExForum, cozy between the 2007 Elite Eight banner and the 2009 Sweet Sixteen flag.
But when the school lost its appeal of sanctions in March 2010, that meant the end of its 2008 buddy, dealt a life sentence in the darkness of a campus closet.
At least, we&apos;ll have to take Johnson&apos;s word for it. The UofM interprets its sanctions from the NCAA as meaning that the banner cannot be photographed, which means The Commercial Appeal&apos;s request to do so this week was turned down.
The pertinent line from the NCAA&apos;s infractions appeals committee report in 2010: &quot;Any public reference to these vacated contests, including the appearance in the 2008 NCAA Division I Men&apos;s Basketball Championship shall be removed from athletics
department stationery, banners displayed in public areas and any other forum in which they appear.&quot;
Most of the life of Memphis&apos; banner had been spent in another nondescript storage area within the university&apos;s athletics office building on Normal. But there remained a concern that a zealous Tiger fan would stumble upon it one day and abscond
with it.
&quot;We&apos;ve got all sorts of fans who would want it,&quot; Johnson said.
So when Johnson obtained this new storage space last year, associate athletic director Bob Winn suggested that the banner be placed there. Johnson agreed.
Memphis is not without precedent. Michigan&apos;s 1992 and 1993 Final Four banners, as well as a 1998 Big Ten banner, are stored at the Bentley Historical Library on campus, spokesman Dave Ablauf said.
Interest in the banner&apos;s location tends to spike this time of year, as the NCAA Tournament offers a reminder of the anniversary, Johnson said.
&quot;We get fans that call, or whatever, they start reminiscing about 2008,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Of course now, with (the Kentucky success of former coach) John (Calipari), that just accentuates it.&quot;
Johnson was hopeful that when the Tigers go off probation on Aug. 19 that the banner could find a more prominent home. Not the FedExForum rafters, but perhaps the Hardaway Hall of Fame down the street. More of a historic document, not a show-off.
But Sheri Lipman, the school&apos;s legal counsel, says that won&apos;t happen. As long as the wins are vacated, the banner will have to remain out of plain sight.

<TI>&apos;Abbott needs personal politics lesson&apos;</TI>
<TEXT>OPPOSITION Leader Tony Abbott has again shown he needs a lesson in &quot;personal politics 101&quot; after making inappropriate remarks for a second time in a week, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon says.
Mr Abbott said he regretted a remark he made in reference to Prime Minister Julia Gillard&apos;s wardrobe and appearance.
Feminist Germaine Greer started the furore after she told an ABC TV panel that Ms Gillard wore unflattering jackets and had a &quot;big arse&quot;.
A woman speaking to Mr Abbott at a community forum in Victoria yesterday raised the subject again saying:
&quot;Get some of those jackets off her&quot; and he replied: &quot;I know, I know, I know. Germaine Greer was right on that subject.&quot;
Mr Abbott said he regretted the remark when quizzed on the Channel 9 today.
&quot;It was an off-the-cuff remark responding to an observation of a member of the public and I shouldn&apos;t have said it and I regret it,&quot; he said.
The latest verbal gaffe came just a week after Mr Abbott apologised in parliament for inappropriately saying Ms Gillard and the leader of the House of Representatives, Anthony Albanese, were &quot;walking around with targets on their foreheads&quot;.
Ms Roxon reminded reporters on Friday that Mr Abbott had abused Bernie Banton when he was dying from asbestos-induced fibrosis, and had &quot;happily&quot; swore at her (Ms Roxon) after a debate at the National Press Club.
&quot;This is Mr Abbott losing control and perhaps being under more pressure than he has been under in a while,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I also think this is Mr Abbott who needs a lesson on personal politics 101 which is, if your wife or girlfriend says, &apos;Does my bum look big in this?&apos; you say, &apos;No&apos; and get on with it.&quot;
She didn&apos;t think it was appropriate for anyone to comment on the prime minister&apos;s clothing, including Ms Greer.
&quot;Germaine Greer really didn&apos;t do herself proud in making those comments,&quot; she said.
Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten agreed, saying it was a case of an iconic feminist having a crack at another successful woman.
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have said what Tony Abbott said, it was just ridiculous,&quot; Mr Shorten told Channel 7.
Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey told the same program it was a &quot;no-go area&quot; for any male to talk about female clothing.
But he told Fairfax radio that the way one dresses and presents themselves does matter because it forms part of the judgment made of an individual.
&quot;For example, I can say to you, with absolute confidence, that you&apos;re unlikely to see me in Speedos,&quot; he said.
But he said both Ms Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan had said some &quot;nasty things&quot; about him in the past.
&quot;For me it&apos;s water off a duck&apos;s back. It&apos;s no revelation that I&apos;m a fully sized guy,&quot; he said.
&quot;Frankly when you pass comment about someone&apos;s weight or something like that I think it says more about you than it does about them.&quot;</TEXT>

<TI>Amerikanske møder om fedme fik Novo til at tage på</TI>
<TEXT>markedsoversigt Novo Nordisk igen trækhesten i et pænt resultat for det danske C20-indeks.
Efter en sløv start på dagen kom der fut under Novo-aktien, som blev løftet fra et niveau omkring 776 kr.
til en slutkurs på 794,50 kr. - en stigning på 1,6 pct.
Aktien vejer omkring 40 pct. i C20-indekset og var dermed en stor årsag til, at det kunne slutte 0,75 pct. højere i indeksniveau 449,64, mens stort set alle andre europæiske markeder faldt.
Novo Nordisk er i fokus, fordi de amerikanske sundhedsmyndigheder i disse dage diskuterer krav til kommende lægemidler til behandling af fedme. Novo Nordisk har diabetesmidlet Victoza på vej som fedmebehandling i de kommende år.
Carlsberg havde også en fremgangsrig dag på børsen og lukkede 1,5 pct. højere i kurs 455,70. Bryggeriaktien blev dermed blandt dagens vindere i C20 og kunne sende sin tak til lovende tal og fremtidsudsigter fra kinesiske Chongqing Brewery, som
Carlsberg ejer en stor aktiepost i.
PNE Wind, der står for Gode Wind I-projektet, fortalte i går, at Vestas blev fravalgt, da selskabets store offshoresatsning, en mølle på 7 MW, stadig er for langt væk.
Kontrakten på 84 af Vestas&apos; 3 MW-møller til Gode Wind II-projektet lever dog fortsat, understreger PNE Winds kommunikationschef, Rainer Heinsohn, over for Ritzau Finans.
Vestas-aktien lukkede 0,1 pct. højere i 58,20 kr.
A. P. Møller -Mærsk-aktierne tilbragte hele dagen i rødt, og B-aktien sluttede i et fald på 0,4 pct. til kurs 42.840.
FLSmidth-aktien er nu faldet 11 af de seneste 13 handelsdage og har nu har krydset den tekniske grænse ved kurs 400. Ingeniøraktien lukkede 2,3 pct. nede i kurs 390,80.
Små udsving i obligationer
De europæiske obligationer viste små udsving onsdag med en lille tendens til faldende renter, især ud på eftermiddagen.
En vellykket italiensk auktion over seksmånederspapirer gav lidt pusterum, men det gældspressede land skal til en større eksamen i dag.
De danske statspapirer lå relativt stille det meste af dagen, men efter et skuffende nøgletal fra USA vendte renterne pilen nedad på eftermiddagen.
Således lukkede den toneangivende tiårige obligation, 3-21&apos; eren, i en rente på 1,85 pct., et fald på 5 basispoint mod tirsdag.
På de andre danske papirer var der tale om fald i lignende niveauer.
I Tyskland og Storbritannien var der lignende rentefald på omtrent 5 basispoint på de tiårige papirer, mens Spanien og Italiens renter viste lidt mindre fald i renten.
Ved en auktion over italienske statsobligationer med seksmåneders løbetid blev der solgt papirer for 8,5 mia. euro til en rente på 1,119 pct. sammenlignet med 1,202 pct. en måned før.
De korte renter holdes dog kunstigt lave af Den Europæiske Centralbanks store likviditetstildeling til bankerne, mener Nordeas analytiker Carsten Rasmussen, der peger på auktionen i dag som en større indikator for støvlelandet.
»Den store prøve på markedets tiltro til den italienske stats evne til at afdrage på sin gæld kommer først i morgen ( i dag, red.), hvor man håber på at sælge op til 8,25 milliarder euro i 5-årige og tiårige statsobligationer«, skrev Carsten
Rasmussen i en note.

<TI>When it comes to the generation gap, respect is a two-way street; Boris Johnson wants to force youngsters to behave well on public transport. Martin Hesp supports the move but says we should try to find why some children have lost respect</TI>
<TEXT>The shame is that this was needed in the first place. How many opinion pieces could I have concluded with those words in the ten years I&apos;ve been a columnist for this newspaper? Hundreds, I should think - and now I&apos;m at it again.
I do so in light of the news that teenagers will be told to &quot;stand up for their elders&quot; on public transport (in London at least) - or risk losing their right to free travel.
At first glance you can&apos;t help but applaud London Mayor Boris Johnson who this week unveiled plans to make youngsters sign a &quot;courtesy pledge&quot; - a promise to behave in a respectful manner when travelling in the capital. Who doesn&apos;t detest the
selfish, yobbish behaviour that seems to have overtaken the old-fashioned world of good manners? Of course, if you were only ever to read certain newspapers of a &quot;s h o ck -horror&quot; bent, you&apos;d probably believe the world is filled with nasty kids who
wouldn&apos;t dream of standing up so an older person could take their seat. But on a couple of recent trips to London I&apos;ve been delighted to see youngsters doing just that on the Tube trains. Not sullenly or reluctantly - nor because someone had pointed out
an old man or a pregnant woman was having to stand while they reposed on their youthful backsides - but instantly and helpfully.
On the other hand, I&apos;m no fool and certainly don&apos;t see life through rose-coloured spectacles. I know today&apos;s youth doesn&apos;t embrace that strange and somewhat ephemeral concept of &quot;respect&quot; in the way people used to.
But why have things like respect and courtesy been on the wane? If you ask someone of my age they might well tell you that they can recall when the requirement for respect was too powerful, demanding and all-embracing. I spent my formative years
in that tidechanging period of the 1960s and 70s when unquestioning, old fashioned, Victorian-style respect was beginning to run out of steam.
It demanded that you kowtowed to your elders all the time - without ever questioning why - even if some of those stationed &quot;above&quot; you in life were bounders, morons or idiots.
The rot in the great tree of respect began to grow in the First World War when some bounders, morons and even idiots were put in charge of fighting troops, thanks solely to their position in a classobsessed society - with horrific and deadly
results.
The Second World War eroded the &quot;re s p e c t -yo u rbetters&quot; scheme of things more - and by the 1960s the idea that you had to bow to certain other elements in society (ie your elders or anyone in a superior financial position) was well and truly
on the slide.
By the 1970s we rebellious youngsters were more likely to cock-a-snook at just about anyone or anything. The older folk around us simply couldn&apos;t understand the crazy, thrill-seeking, fun-obsessed new world of youth - and likewise the kids
couldn&apos;t understand the fast disappearing era when duty, reverence and unquestioning compliance had meant far more than a person&apos;s happiness. Throw in the later &quot;there&apos;s no such thing as society&quot; ideas of Margaret Thatcher&apos;s gang and the subsequent
&quot;importance of individual choice&quot; politics thereafter - and what have you got? A society that tends to think &quot;me&quot; first - and &quot;you and everyone else&quot; a distant second, if at all.
It&apos;s certainly a society that has lost the will to put community and universal responsibility high on every agenda. You only have to look at the present Government&apos;s present idea that our amazing, fragile and hugely vital environment comes second
to temporary financial gain to know that.
When the likes of Boris Johnson, and the rest of us for that matter, see some skulking youth squatting selfishly on a seat when someone more deserving is left to stand, we should not be looking at two individuals in a Tube train - we should be
seeing a vast social disaster zone and wondering what to do about it.
I have no problem with the Mayor of London taking steps to force ideas of respect and courtesy on young people - but I do think it&apos;s a bit like seeing someone take an aspirin for toothache when the offending molar obviously needs major root canal
work.
Children need to be taught about their part in society - what they can expect from it, and what it can expect from them - from an early age. The problem is that new generations learn best when led by example - so perhaps we so-called &quot;elders&quot; need
to clean up our act.
In a world where shockhorror media targets the lowest common denominator; where TV executives and celebrities seem to exalt &quot;lad&quot; behaviour and other unthinking buffoonery above culture and good taste; and where politicians are quite happy to
hijack our one-andonly life-giving countryside in return for a fast buck - what do we expect our kids to think?&apos;Who doesn&apos;t detest the yobbish behaviour that seems to have overtaken the oldfashioned world of good manners?&apos;</TEXT>

<TI>&apos;Abbott needs personal politics lesson&apos;</TI>
<TEXT>OPPOSITION Leader Tony Abbott has again shown he needs a lesson in &quot;personal politics 101&quot; after making inappropriate remarks for a second time in a week, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon says.
Mr Abbott said he regretted a remark he made in reference to Prime Minister Julia Gillard&apos;s wardrobe and appearance.
Feminist Germaine Greer started the furore after she told an ABC TV panel that Ms Gillard wore unflattering jackets and had a &quot;big arse&quot;.
A woman speaking to Mr Abbott at a community forum in Victoria yesterday raised the subject again saying:
&quot;Get some of those jackets off her&quot; and he replied: &quot;I know, I know, I know. Germaine Greer was right on that subject.&quot;
Mr Abbott said he regretted the remark when quizzed on the Channel 9 today.
&quot;It was an off-the-cuff remark responding to an observation of a member of the public and I shouldn&apos;t have said it and I regret it,&quot; he said.
The latest verbal gaffe came just a week after Mr Abbott apologised in parliament for inappropriately saying Ms Gillard and the leader of the House of Representatives, Anthony Albanese, were &quot;walking around with targets on their foreheads&quot;.
Ms Roxon reminded reporters on Friday that Mr Abbott had abused Bernie Banton when he was dying from asbestos-induced fibrosis, and had &quot;happily&quot; swore at her (Ms Roxon) after a debate at the National Press Club.
&quot;This is Mr Abbott losing control and perhaps being under more pressure than he has been under in a while,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I also think this is Mr Abbott who needs a lesson on personal politics 101 which is, if your wife or girlfriend says, &apos;Does my bum look big in this?&apos; you say, &apos;No&apos; and get on with it.&quot;
She didn&apos;t think it was appropriate for anyone to comment on the prime minister&apos;s clothing, including Ms Greer.
&quot;Germaine Greer really didn&apos;t do herself proud in making those comments,&quot; she said.
Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten agreed, saying it was a case of an iconic feminist having a crack at another successful woman.
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have said what Tony Abbott said, it was just ridiculous,&quot; Mr Shorten told Channel 7.
Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey told the same program it was a &quot;no-go area&quot; for any male to talk about female clothing.
But he told Fairfax radio that the way one dresses and presents themselves does matter because it forms part of the judgment made of an individual.
&quot;For example, I can say to you, with absolute confidence, that you&apos;re unlikely to see me in Speedos,&quot; he said.
But he said both Ms Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan had said some &quot;nasty things&quot; about him in the past.
&quot;For me it&apos;s water off a duck&apos;s back. It&apos;s no revelation that I&apos;m a fully sized guy,&quot; he said.
&quot;Frankly when you pass comment about someone&apos;s weight or something like that I think it says more about you than it does about them.&quot;</TEXT>

<TI>Fyringsdrama skader Dong</TI>
<TEXT>DONG Anders Eldrup har »tilsidesat« og »misligholdt« sine forpligtelser som direktør, konkluderer en advokatundersøgelse. Hovedpersonen vil fortsætte sagen ved en voldgift og retter nu en skarp kritik mod bestyrelsesformand Fritz Schur.
Der var tale om en magtdemonstration, da bestyrelsesformand Fritz Schur i går satte trumf på i fyringssagen om den statsejede energigigants topchef, Anders Eldrup.
Først fik han politikernes opbakning, og så gik han til pressemøde flankeret af næstformand Lars Nørby Johansen, Novodirektør Lars Rieben og advokat Mariann Norrbom og fremlagde resultaterne af den ventede advokatundersøgelse.
Den konkluderer i utvetydige vendinger, at Anders Eldrup har misligholdt sin kontrakt ved at give en lille gruppe nøglemedarbejdere lukrative løn-og bonusvilkår - uden at informere bestyrelsen. Konklusionen blev blåstemplet af Kammeradvokaten Den
højdramatiske sag efterlader imidlertid Danmarks vigtigste energiselskab med alvorlige imageproblemer, vurderer en ekspert.
»Hele sagen efterlader et Dong med alvorlige ridser i lakken og et blakket image.
Det har på ingen måde været en god sag for et selskab, der måske i forvejen ikke var særligt populær blandt kunderne«, siger Mogens Rüdiger, professor på Aalborg Universitet og forfatter til en bog om Dong.
I Dongs bestyrelse erkender man, at fyringssagen ikke har været god for virksomheden, der spiller en nøglerolle i bestræbelsen på at omstille det danske samfund til grøn energi.
»På vindmølleområdet er der klart sket et imagetab, som skal rettes op«, siger næstformand Lars Nørby Johansen.
På et pressemøde i går kom det frem, at den nu fyrede topdirektør reelt har været udsat for pression fra fire nøglemedarbejdere, der angiveligt har ageret som en samlet gruppe og igen og igen opsøgte Eldrup og pressede ham til stadigt mere
lukrative løn-og ansættelsesvilkår under truslen om ellers at forlade selskabet til fordel for konkurrenterne.
»Jeg har aldrig set noget lignende. Det er helt uhørt, det der er foregået. Det er kommet ud på et skråplan, det her. De pågældende medarbejdere har kunnet presse direktøren, og så har det udviklet sig til en skrue uden ende«, sagde
bestyrelsesmedlem og administrerende direktør i Novo Nordisk, Lars Rieben.
Samlet konkluderer advokatundersøgelsen, at Anders Eldrup har »tilsidesat« og »misligholdt« sine forpligtelser som direktør ved gennem syv år at have givet de fire centrale medarbejdere meget store beløb i godtgørelser og bonus, som lå »langt ud
over« Dongs generelle retningslinjer, uden at have orienteret bestyrelsen om det.
Ifølge næstformand Lars Nørby Johansen har Anders Eldrup, ved ikke at gå til bestyrelsen med nøglemedarbejdernes krav, reelt udøvet en form for selvtægt.
»Han burde være gået til os, i stedet skete der noget, man bedst kan betegne som selvtægt«, sagde han.
Anders Eldrup er stærkt uenig i advokatundersøgelsen, som han kalder et »partsindlæg«. Han vil derfor have sagen behandlet ved en voldgift, blandt andet fordi bestyrelsen på baggrund af rapporten har besluttet at nægte ham hans fulde
fratrædelsesgodtgørelse.
Mens Eldrup kræver 17 millioner kroner, er bestyrelsen kun parat til at give ham 6.
I sådan en sag skal man ikke afskrive Anders Eldrups chancer, vurderer Peter Breum, partner i advokatfirmaet Elmer &amp; Partnere.
»En voldgiftsag vil tegne et noget mere nuanceret billede, end det der kommer frem i undersøgelsen«, siger han.
Efter fjorten dages tavshed retter Eldrup i dag i Politiken desuden en stærk kritik af bestyrelsesformand Fritz Schurs ledelse af det statslige selskab: »Al kontakt mellem ejeren (finansministeren, red.) og selskabet er foregået gennem Schur. Det
er helt usædvanligt. Jeg har været direktør for statens langt, langt største selskab uden nogen sinde at drøfte med ejeren, hvordan han ønskede selskabet udviklet. Schur har monopol på, hvad ejeren får at vide, og hvad der blev fortalt tilbage til
bestyrelsen«, siger Anders Eldrup, der oplyser, at han - da Fritz Schur blev formand for seks år siden - fik forbud mod at tale med ministeren, departementschefen eller embedsmændene i øvrigt i Finansministeriet.
»Det var kafkask og skabte et miljø, hvor mistillid trives«, siger Eldrup og understreger, at han som direktør i Dong ikke har overtrådt nogen regler.
Dong&apos;s kommunikationschef, Karsten Anker Petersen, skriver i en mail til Politiken, at bestyrelsesformand Fritz Schur »ikke ønsker at bidrage til konflikt til skade for Dong«, og at bestyrelsesformanden »derfor ikke har nogen kommentarer«. Også
Finansminister Bjaren Corydon (S) afviser at forholde sig til den fyrede direktørs kritik: »Jeg har ikke nogen kommentar til den debat, der kører i mellem Anders Eldrup og bestyrelsen i Dong. Jeg har tillid til bestyrelsen og bakker op om dens
beslutning«, siger han.

<TI>Hurley Student ambassadors tell of journeys with diabetes, asthma</TI>
<TEXT>Continued from A1
Hurley Benefit Ball, which raises money for the children&apos;s hospital.
&quot;It&apos;s a proud moment. You just know you&apos;ve come through so much,&quot; Austin said in an interview with The Flint Journal. &quot;I think it makes you a stronger person. ... Some people don&apos;t truly understand what (asthma) does, how it changes your life.&quot;
Austin was born with underdeveloped lungs. For more than a year, he was treated for upper respiratory infections, one after the other, before he was diagnosed with having asthma at age 3.
It was hard for him to breathe, making it difficult for him to do much of anything else, including walk, play outside or even tie his shoes. During his first time sledding at age 5, he collapsed at the bottom of the hill and had to be rushed to
the hospital.
From age 6 to 10, Austin&apos;s asthma was at its worst. He was on 11 medications. Between October and March, it was almost a guarantee that he would be in the hospital regularly. Two attacks were so bad Austin almost died.
He spent most of his time inside, away from anything that could create an attack.
&quot;I pretty much lived in the hospital. I had someone doing everything for me, carrying me. ... In some way, I feel like I missed out on childhood a little,&quot; Austin said. &quot;It kind of just made you feel bad. ... Why me? You felt left behind that you
couldn&apos;t do what the other kids could do.&quot;
Susan Perez, Austin&apos;s mother, said it was a scary time for the family. Just walking out into the cold could send Austin into an attack.
He and his family were given guidance and education on how to control and deal with his asthma. At age 10, Austin found a medication to help with allergies and asthma. It dramatically reduced his symptoms. In fact, he can&apos;t remember the last time
he&apos;s been to the hospital past age 10.
But the journey has left him a different person, his mother said.
&quot;I was afraid to let him out of the house,&quot; said Perez, adding how proud she was of how he handled it all. &quot;(The whole experience) made him a really responsible kid. It made him grow up fast.&quot;
Now he gets a shot at a normal life, Austin said.
&quot;It&apos;s amazing. I&apos;ve tried new things, got to try new sports,&quot; he said, thanking the staff at Hurley for all their help and support. &quot;Now I&apos;ve got my goals on what I&apos;m going to achieve. I can do anything and it&apos;s awesome.&quot;
Austin and April were chosen to be representatives at the upcoming ball by various clinical staff at Hurley, said Hurley spokeswoman Ilene Cantor. And they are proud to have them tell their stories and offer inspiration to others, she said.
Dealing with diabetes
April&apos;s story started around Christmas 2006. She was 8 and had symptoms of what she thought was the flu -- fatigue, weight loss, frequent urination and a constant thirst.
Within a month, April had lost 5 to 7 pounds, and she went to see a doctor. Her blood sugar level was so high it didn&apos;t even register in blood tests.
She was diagnosed with a disease that would stick with her for the rest of her life -- Type I juvenile diabetes, a disease in which the body does not properly produce insulin. She spent the next three days in Hurley&apos;s Pediatric Intensive Care Unit
and two more in the pediatric area there.
&quot;I was feeling horrible. I didn&apos;t know what was going on. ... I couldn&apos;t get over it,&quot; said April, who is now in the homebound program at Flint International Academy. &quot;I felt overwhelmed because I was 8 years old. I wanted to be carefree, and now
I had all this responsibility of dealing with this disease.&quot;
Her life would never be the same.
April now checks her blood sugar four to six times a day and gives herself insulin at least four times a day or uses an insulin pump. She had trained herself to count carbohydrates and be careful of everything she eats. Eating sweets in moderation
is particularly important.
Too much physical activity can be dangerous for her blood sugar, as well.
Her blood sugar fluctuates constantly. She never knows when it&apos;s going to be too high or too low. Twice she has gone into diabetic ketoacidosis, when she had too much acid in her blood and had to be rushed to the hospital.
&quot;When I have high blood sugar, I&apos;m tired, thirsty, irritated. (Diabetic ketoacidosis) is like that times 10. My heart beats really fast. Sometimes I vomit, have rapid breathing, burning sensation in my chest,&quot; April said.
&quot;It was the worst feeling in the world. I thought I was going to die. I thought I would never feel normal again. It&apos;s hard to feel normal when you have diabetes. It&apos;s up and down. It&apos;s a roller coaster.&quot;
Tonya LaGrone, April&apos;s mother, said it has been difficult to watch her daughter go through so much, but she is proud of how she&apos;s handled it.
&quot;Despite all her challenges, she&apos;s been courageous. She&apos;s a fighter,&quot; LaGrone said. &quot;She still likes to project that she&apos;s a normal teenager.&quot;
April said she has grown through the experience and hopes she can help others in the same situation.
She&apos;s proud to represent the children&apos;s hospital at the upcoming ball, she said.
&quot;I&apos;ve had to grow up really fast. I have all of these responsibilities of how to take care of myself,&quot; April said. &quot;No kid wants to be diagnosed with a disease they will have for the rest of their life. But it could be worse. ... (I want kids with
diabetes to know) you can get through this. I thought it was the end of the world. But you can get through this.
&quot;What doesn&apos;t kill you makes you stronger.&quot;</TEXT>

<TI>Boris on right track with new era of bus respect; Boris Johnson wants to force youngsters to behave well on public transport. Martin Hesp supports the move but says we should try to find out why some children have lost respect in the first place</TI>
<TEXT>The shame is that this scheme to force youngsters on public transport to behave well was needed in the first place. How many opinion pieces could I have concluded with those words in the ten years I&apos;ve been a columnist? Hundreds, I should think -
and now I&apos;m at it again.
I do so in light of the news that teenagers will be told to &quot;stand up for their elders&quot; on public transport (in London at least) - or risk losing their right to free travel.
At first glance you can&apos;t help but applaud London Mayor Boris Johnson who this week unveiled plans to make youngsters sign a &quot;courtesy pledge&quot; - a promise to behave in a respectful manner when travelling.
Who doesn&apos;t detest the selfish, yobbish behaviour that seems to have overtaken the old-fashioned world of good manners? Of course, if you were only ever to read certain newspapers of a &quot;s h o ck -horror&quot; bent, you&apos;d probably believe the world is
filled with nasty kids who wouldn&apos;t dream of standing up so an older person could take their seat. But on a couple of recent trips to London I&apos;ve been delighted to see youngsters doing just that on the Tube trains. Not sullenly or reluctantly - nor
because someone had pointed out an old man or a pregnant woman was having to stand while they reposed on their youthful backsides - but instantly and helpfully.
On the other hand, I&apos;m no fool and certainly don&apos;t see life through rose-coloured spectacles. I know today&apos;s youth doesn&apos;t embrace that strange and somewhat ephemeral concept of &quot;respect&quot; in the way people used to.
But why have things like respect and courtesy been on the wane? If you ask someone of my age they might well tell you that they can recall when the requirement for respect was too powerful, demanding and all-embracing. I spent my formative years
in that tidechanging period of the 1960s and 70s when unquestioning, old fashioned, Victorian-style respect was beginning to run out of steam. It demanded that you kowtowed to your elders all the time - without ever questioning why - even if some of
those stationed &quot;above&quot; you in life were bounders, morons or idiots.
The rot in the great tree of respect began to grow in the First World War when some bounders, morons and even idiots were put in charge of fighting troops, thanks solely to their position in a classobsessed society - with horrific and deadly
results.
The Second World War eroded the &quot;re s p e c t -yo u rbetters&quot; scheme of things more - and by the 1960s the idea that you had to bow to certain other elements in society (i.e. your elders or anyone in a superior financial position) was well and
truly on the slide. By the 1970s we rebellious youngsters were more likely to cock-a-snook at just about anyone or anything. The older folk around us simply couldn&apos;t understand the crazy, thrillseeking, fun-obsessed new world of youth - and likewise the
kids couldn&apos;t understand the fast disappearing era when duty, reverence and unquestioning compliance had meant far more than a person&apos;s happiness. Throw in the later &quot;there&apos;s no such thing as society&quot; ideas of Margaret Thatcher&apos;s gang and the subsequent
&quot;importance of individual choice&quot; politics thereafter - and what have you got? A society that tends to think &quot;me&quot; first - and &quot;you and everyone else&quot; a distant second, if at all.
It&apos;s certainly a society that has lost the will to put community and universal responsibility high on every agenda. You only have to look at the present Government&apos;s present idea that our amazing, fragile and hugely vital environment comes second
to temporary financial gain to know that.
When the likes of Boris Johnson, and the rest of us for that matter, see some skulking youth squatting selfishly on a seat when someone more deserving is left to stand, we should not be looking at two people on a bus - we should be seeing a social
disaster zone and wondering what to do about it.
I have no problem with the Mayor of London taking steps to force ideas of respect and courtesy on young people - but I do think it&apos;s a bit like seeing someone take an aspirin for toothache when the offending molar obviously needs some major root
canal work. Children need to be taught about their part in society - what they can expect from it, and what it can expect from them - from an early age. The problem is that new generations learn best when led by example - so perhaps we so-called
&quot;elders&quot; need to clean up our act.
In a world where shockhorror media targets the lowest common denominator; where TV executives and celebrities seem to exalt &quot;lad&quot; behaviour and other unthinking buffoonery above culture and good taste; and where politicians are quite happy to
hijack our one-andonly life-giving countryside in return for a fast buck - what do we expect our kids to think?&apos;Why have things like respect and courtesy been on the wane?&apos;</TEXT>

<TI>Dongs lønkomité blev advaret i 2009</TI>
<TEXT>pressemøde Dongs fyrede topchef forsøgte at sløre oplysninger om lønfrås i notat til bestyrelsen i 2009. Alligevel burde bestyrelsen have lugtet lunten, mener ekspert.
Dongs bestyrelse blev tilbage i 2009 orienteret om, at visse af selskabets nøglemedarbejdere havde helt særlige løn-og bonusvilkår, der rakte langt ud over selskabets generelle retningslinjer for lønvilkår for de ansatte.
Det fremgår af Kammeradvokatens advokatundersøgelse af forholdene i Dong, som blev offentliggjort i går.
Spørgsmålet om bestyrelsens kendskab til de usædvanlige lønforhold for fire af den nu fyrede topchef Anders Eldrups nærmeste medarbejdere er helt centralt i sagen. Bestyrelsens hovedargument for at skille sig af med Eldrup er nemlig, at Eldrup
undlod at informere bestyrelsens vederlagskomité om de usædvanlige forhold, som han skulle.
Men ifølge Kammeradvokatens undersøgelse modtog komitéen i august 2009 et notat, hvoraf det blandt andet fremgik: »I enkelttilfælde er der indført særskilte kompensationselementer for nøglepersoner.
Det kan for eksempel være i form af fastholdelsesordninger, særlige performanceafhængige ydelser, kompensation for flere jobfunktioner m. v.«, fremgår det MICHAEL LUND af Kammeradvokatens undersøgelse.
»Vederlagskomiteen har herved haft en vis anledning til at stille spørgsmål til det nærmere indhold af disse særordninger«, konkluderer Kammeradvokaten.
Komiteen består blandt andet af bestyrelsesformand Fritz Schur og næstformand Lars Nørby Johansen, der flere gange har nægtet at kende til forholdene og har forsvaret komiteens arbejde.
Men professor i ledelse ved Aalborg Universitet Per Nikolaj Bukh mener, at vederlagskomiteen her forsømte en åbenlys mulighed for at tage sagen op: »Her havde det været oplagt for bestyrelsen at spørge mere ind til emnet. Hvad er de største
lønninger, hvilke lønninger afviger mest fra normalen, hvor mange er der tale om, er blot nogle af de mest oplagte spørgsmål, de burde have stillet.
Man kan nok ikke direkte sige, at vederlagskomiteen har forsømt sin pligt, men det havde været smart at stille disse spørgsmål dengang«, siger han.
Kammeradvokaten konkluderer overordnet, at Anders Eldrup forsømte at orientere bestyrelsen korrekt og fyldestgørende, og at fyringen af ham derfor var helt efter bogen. Desuden påpeger advokaterne, at Eldrup aktivt rettede i de afsnit i
2009-notatet, der omtalte de pågældende nøglemedarbejderes lønforhold, så visse afslørende detaljer om lønforholdene aldrig nåede bestyrelsen.
På et pressemøde i Dongs bygninger i Gentofte i går afviste bestyrelsesmedlemmerne og deres advokater da også, at vederlagskomiteen reagerede forkert på 2009-notatet. Tværtimod forsøgte komiteen at indhente oplysninger om løn-og bonusforhold for
det lavere lederniveau, lød det: »Og de oplysninger får vi aldrig, selv om vi stiller spørgsmålet«, lød det fra Lars Nørby Johansen.
Hvorfor fulgte I ikke op på det? »Vi fik det kun oplyst som gennemsnitsløn«, supplerede Fritz Schur.
Og det var I tilfredse med? »Som der står klart og tydeligt i Kammeradvokatens redegørelse, så er det op til en direktør at give fyldestgørende oplysninger til bestyrelsen. Det har han tilsidesat«, konstaterede Fritz Schur.
»Mit indtryk er, at vederlagskomiteen i Dong har fungeret, som den gør de fleste andre steder«, supplerede Lars Nørby.
Den tredje repræsentant fra bestyrelsen, administrerende direktør i Novo Nordisk, Lars Rebien Sørensen, gav sin fulde opbakning til vederlagskomiteen.
»Sådan fungerer det også i andre virksomheder.
Jeg orienterer selv min bestyrelse, hvis bare jeg giver en måneds ekstra bonus til en ansat, netop for ikke at ende i et mistillidsforhold til bestyrelsen«.
På pressemødet kommenterede Novochefen for første gang balladen i energiselskabet, siden striden brød ud, og han gentog, hvad hans bestyrelseskolleger har sagt gennem de seneste uger om lønforholdene for de fire medarbejdere: »Jeg har aldrig set
noget lignende. Det er helt uhørt, det, der er foregået. De pågældende medarbejdere har kunnet presse direktøren, og så har det udviklet sig til en skrue uden ende«.
Ingen grøn uenighed
Et tilbagevendende emne på pressemødet var de seneste dages historier om, at fyringen skulle bunde i en uenighed om hastigheden af Dongs grønne strategi. At Fritz Schur skulle have ønsket at skaffe sig af med Eldrup, fordi direktøren satsede for
aggressivt på blandt andet havvindmøller.
Og at Eldrup skulle have konkrete planer om helt at udskille Dongs afdeling for vindenergi i et nyt selskab. Men at det skulle spille en rolle, blev afvist.
»Det omtalte projekt er slet ikke forelagt bestyrelsen. Vi har kun fået nogle spredte notater og har selv bedt om nogle.
Det er slet ikke grydeklart over for bestyrelsen, så den ville kunne træffe en beslutning på det«, sagde Fritz Schur.
Både Rebien og Nørby understregede, at bestyrelsen støttede alle dele af Anders Eldrups hidtidige strategi.
»Der er ikke engang en uenighed om tempoet. Der er vedtaget en strategi, og den fastholder vi naturligvis. Den finansieringsmodel, der er lavet med blandt andre pensionskasser, synes vi er fantastisk spændende, og den vil vi gerne fortsætte med.
Der er ingen uenighed, og det var slet ikke inde i overvejelserne omkring fyringen«, sagde Nørby Johansen.

Fakta: Dong-sagen dag for dag
I gennem den seneste måned har der været blæst om det statsejede energiselskab Dong Energy Bestyrelsesformand i Dong, Fritz Schur, får et tip om, at Anders Eldrup har bevilget flere medarbejdere særlige lønforhold.
Bestyrelsen er ikke orienteret og undersøger derfor sagen. Fritz Schur orienterer Finansministeriet om, at der pågår en undersøgelse i Dong Energy. Fritz Schur hyrer advokatfirmaet Norrbom Vinding til at lave en undersøgelse af forholdene. Fritz
Schur orienterer bestyrelsen. Bestyrelsen er enig om at afskedige Eldrup.
Schur forelægger beslutningen for Eldrup. De aftaler, at Eldrup formelt selv siger op, mod udbetaling af fuldt fratrædelsesbeløb. Afskedigelsen bliver offentliggjort uden begrundelse og efter gensidig overenskomst.
Aftrædelsesviklkår er endeligt aftalt.
Økonomidirektør Carsten Krogsgaard konstitueres som adm. direktør. Dong Energy oplyser, at Anders Eldrups afskedigelse skyldes, at bestyrelsen har mistet tilliden til direktøren. En advokatundersøgelse skal blandt andet fastslå, om Anders Eldrup
skal have hele sin opsigelsesløn på 17 mio. kr. Bestyrelsesformand Fritz Schur forklarer på et pressemøde, at en af Anders Eldrups medarbejdere, Jakob Baruël Poulsen, har fået højere løn end Eldrup selv, og at vedkommende ved opsigelse kunne forlade
Dong Energy med op til 20 mio. kr. Flere medier skriver, at en strid om Dong Energys strategi kigger bag afskedigelsen af Anders Eldrup. En uvildig advokatundersøgelse bliver offentliggjort.</TEXT>

<TI>Nightmare vision of our brave new world? In my opinion</TI>
<TEXT>I popped in to my local supermarket yesterday to buy some cigarettes and a few other bits and bobs and what a depressing experience it was. I thought the tobacco counter was closed for the day as the shutters were pulled down but the assistant
told me it was in fact open but under a new Government policy tobacco products had to be hidden from view. To stave off the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal I thought I&apos;d indulge in some comfort food but alas I couldn&apos;t get to the pizza shelves due to
the presence of two new Government Anti-Obesity Attack Dogs stationed there. &quot;Never mind&quot;, I thought to myself &quot;I&apos;ll have a nice large hot pasty to console myself.&quot; With ninja-like stealth I made it to the hot food counter only to be told that if I
wanted my pasty hot I would have to pay tax on it.
I asked the assistant at what temperature a pasty breached the thermal scale and became classified as &quot;hot&quot; but unfortunately she didn&apos;t know and the only person with a doctorate in thermal physics was on a break. Utterly confused but not
undaunted I crept towards the alcohol display with the intention of spending the few pounds in my pocket on some ale. My route took me dangerously close to the fruit and veg aisle and sure enough one of the new Government Salad Enforcement Officers
tried to manhandle me towards the lettuce display but I managed to fight him off. The scene at the beers &amp; ciders aisle left me in despair as all the affordable brands had undergone a price hike because of another Government policy!
I admitted defeat and shuffled out of the supermarket only to be accosted by a shady looking chap called Dimitri who offered to sell me &quot;genuine&quot; doughnuts from the back of his van. Despite my lack of goods I declined the offer as I feared they
were in fact Eastern European in origin and they are known to contain abnormal levels of real jam. Besides it could have been a set-up and I really didn&apos;t need a conviction for possession of Class A sugar. I couldn&apos;t even fill up the car and take myself
off for a drive to cheer myself up as the tax on diesel meant that I could only afford to drive for pleasure if I had use of a ministerial limo!

<TI>Children&apos;s growth and development is in the balance; Food for thought on eating habits</TI>
<TEXT>If it is green or looks healthy, many kids would rather skip the main course and go straight on to dessert.
When it comes to healthy eating, some children are just not interested. But eating a healthy, balanced diet is key to making sure children get the nutrients they need.
Try to educate kids on what health benefits certain foods can have. For example, calcium-rich foods will help them to grow strong bones.
You can even &quot;hide&quot; the healthy foods by, for example, adding extra vegetables in pasta sauce.
&quot;Healthy eating is vital for a child&apos;s growth and development and establishing healthy eating patterns as a child paves the way to life-long healthy habits,&quot; says Jack Farrow, a fitness, nutrition and weight management coach at Fit4Fun.
Jack highlights the importance of a healthy diet to avoid children becoming overweight.
He says if children are obese, they tend to be obese as adults and have an increased risk of developing type-2 diabetes, joint and bone problems, hypoventilation, gall bladder disease, high blood pressure and high levels of blood fat.
&quot;The risk of obesity can be reduced by reducing the sugar and fat intake and eating more carbohydrates and fibre, along with increasing the amount of physical activity,&quot; Jack says.
A balanced diet will contain lots of different foods. One important food group is calcium.
&quot;A lack of calcium in a child&apos;s diet can lead to bone conditions such as rickets and osteoporosis,&quot; Jack says.
&quot;Foods such as semi-skimmed milk, low-fat yoghurt, low-fat cheese and sardines with the bones in are all great sources of calcium. Roughly two to four servings of calcium rich food are required each day, depending on your child&apos;s age.
&quot;And remember, they also need to get out and play in the sunlight - this helps the body produce Vitamin D, which helps the body absorb the calcium properly.&quot;
To make sure children are getting the nutrients they need, Jack suggests introducing children to new foods and giving them a balanced diet containing carbohydrates, protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals.
&quot;If they don&apos;t like something the first time, it doesn&apos;t mean they will never like it. Try it again. A good old plate of lean meat/fish, starchy food, and a few vegetables is often hard to beat,&quot; Jack says.
It&apos;s also important to get portion sizes right. Make sure your children&apos;s meals are balanced and that the portion sizes are smaller than that of a typical adult.
You can find out more about Fit4Fun by e-mailing info@fit4fun.co or visiting
? If you have any concerns about your child&apos;s health or weight, see your GP.
Cut out excess sugar and salt To keep your child as healthy as possible, cutting out excess salt and sugar will help.
&quot;Too much salt can cause health problems in childhood and adulthood,&quot; Jack says.
&quot;Avoid things like crisps, salty meats, salty sauces and adding more salt to food at the dinner table. This way, children won&apos;t develop the taste for it later in life.
&quot;Save sugary treat foods for holidays and parties and try to get children to snack on low-sugar and fat foods. Use trips to the park as reward, rather than sweets.&quot;
By cutting down on sugary foods, it can reduce energy peak and troughs, combat mood swings, increase concentration and, of course, reduce the risk of significant weight gain.</TEXT>

<TI>&apos;Treme&apos; trickle-down; Some positive effects of the show are hard to measure, but HBO&apos;s Saturday gala will directly benefit three local artist-aid groups</TI>
<TEXT>&quot;Treme&apos;s&quot; economic effect is tangible but sometimes hard to measure.
The HBO drama spends upward of $30 million per season on the New Orleans-set-and-shot series. Local actors, technicians and musicians get some of that.
The two seasons of the series to air so far have exposed a weekly average of about 2 million viewers to corners of New Orleans culture -- second-line organizations, Mardi Gras Indians, Davis Rogan -- that have never before seen such widespread
attention. Some of those viewers are coming here, for the first time, to see it all for themselves. DVD boxes of the episodes -- season two is due for release April 17 -- add to the total.
Digital sales of soundtrack cuts also have spiked from the HBO exposure.
On Saturday, however, HBO and &quot;Treme&quot; will contribute in a very direct way, staging their third annual &quot;My Darlin&apos; New Orleans&quot; benefit.
In addition to music, food, auction items and a chance to mingle with cast and crew members, the evening offers attendees an opportunity to see and hear and taste the &quot;Treme&quot; effect in person.
The past two such events have raised more than $175,000 total to benefit organizations that provide support and safety-net services to the people who fuel the culture that the series spotlights.
This year, funds will go to Sweet Home New Orleans, the New Orleans Musicians Clinic and Assistance Foundation and The Roots of Music.
Online $150 ticket sales conclude today. A limited number of tickets will be available at the door. Both previous &quot;My Darlin&apos; New Orleans&quot; evenings sold out.
Sweet Home New Orleans concentrates on the business side of the sustainability struggle for musicians, second-line organizations and Mardi Gras Indians.
It aims &quot;to make people a little more savvy about what they need to do to promote their musical careers, and tries to erase some of the digital divide, which is really an issue for our constituents,&quot; said Sue Mobley, executive director.
Mobley said one of the organization&apos;s projects is working with musician Stafford Agee -- who plays the notes that emerge from Antoine Batiste&apos;s trombone on &quot;Treme&quot; -- to set up a horn-repair business in New Orleans.
&quot;Which is something we really need here,&quot; Mobley said. &quot;It would be tremendous for the brass bands. We&apos;re such a bigger brass town than anywhere.&quot;
Just as Sweet Home New Orleans helps musicians and others deal with fiscal-health issues, the New Orleans Musicians Clinic attends to their corporeal welfare, funding dental, hearing, diabetes and podiatric care, among many health-care needs.
Foot care might seem minor, but in the community the clinic serves, it&apos;s not.
&quot;When you look at Mardi Gras Indians and second-liners and the brass bands, you realize how many of them suffer from diabetes, (and you see) how vital it is that they have their legs,&quot; said Bethany Bultman, clinic founder and president.
For diabetic musicians who travel, the clinic arranges contacts and care in other cities when needed.
&quot;So when our patients leave New Orleans on gigs out of town or even out of the country, we have a broad network of doctors that we can access for our patients,&quot; Bultman said. &quot;We try to be a member of the band.&quot;
The Roots of Music, co-founded by drummer Derrick Tabb, is the pipeline for New Orleans&apos; music of the future.
The after-school music program for local kids also provides academic tutoring, a hot meal and transportation, no small job considering that some 70 percent of the band&apos;s members don&apos;t have family vehicles.
Some of &quot;My Darlin&apos; New Orleans&quot; benefit money may help fund one upcoming super-sized road trip: The Roots of Music Crusaders have been invited to march in the 2013 Rose Bowl Parade.
&quot;It&apos;s awesome,&quot; said Allison Reinhardt, executive director and co-founder. &quot;It really is a great honor, but it&apos;s a steep cost.&quot;
Which goes atop year-round operating costs.
&quot;All of our kids are low-income,&quot; Reinhardt said. &quot;Our program is built to really accommodate children who don&apos;t have the resources for private academic tutoring or private music lessons. Even group lessons are just so expensive.&quot;
The Crusaders made a memorable entrance at last year&apos;s &quot;My Darlin&apos; New Orleans&quot; benefit, and are slated for an appearance again this year.
&quot;I&apos;ve got to tell you, the people at HBO have been so amazing to us by putting the spotlight on our children,&quot; Reinhardt said. &quot;We&apos;ve gotten support from them individually. David Simon has been really great to us.&quot;
Simon, with &quot;Treme&quot; co-creator Eric Overmyer, will be there Saturday night. Series actors Wendell Pierce, Clarke Peters, Melissa Leo, Lucia Micarelli and Michiel Huisman and new cast member Chris Coy are among those expected to attend. Irma Thomas
headlines the music lineup. Food will be prepared by local super-chefs Susan Spicer, Tory McPhail and Alon Shaya.
Auction items will include a signed Drew Brees jersey, a chance to appear on &quot;Treme&quot; during its third season (currently filming around town), a 1970 Jazz Fest poster that until recently hung in Preservation Hall and a Hammond B3 organ signed by
Dr. John, Art Neville, Gregg Allman and JoJo Hermann of Widespread Panic.
This &quot;Treme&quot; effect will be measurable.
The organizations that will benefit from funds raised have seen it on the streets, too.
No question, interest in Mardi Gras Indians, both locally and from visitors, appears to be much higher than it was before the series made one of its characters a gang chief.
Sweet Home New Orleans&apos; Mobley also believes the series has made a difference inside the communities from which future Indians will come.
&quot;It&apos;s sort of a fascinating case, because it&apos;s such a private culture,&quot; Mobley said. &quot;I think there&apos;s some sense of conflict about being thrown into the limelight, but I also think that people are valuing or re-evaluating how they&apos;re seen.
&quot;I think that it has helped interest more people who could be part of the culture in becoming part of it. I think it&apos;s interested more people who are outsiders to learn more about it, to be engaged with it.
&quot;Super Sunday this year was the biggest crowd I&apos;ve seen, ever.&quot;

<TI>&apos;Abbott needs personal politics lesson&apos;</TI>
<TEXT>OPPOSITION Leader Tony Abbott has again shown he needs a lesson in &quot;personal politics 101&quot; after making inappropriate remarks for a second time in a week, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon says.
Mr Abbott said he regretted a remark he made in reference to Prime Minister Julia Gillard&apos;s wardrobe and appearance.
Feminist Germaine Greer started the furore after she told an ABC TV panel that Ms Gillard wore unflattering jackets and had a &quot;big arse&quot;.
A woman speaking to Mr Abbott at a community forum in Victoria yesterday raised the subject again saying:
&quot;Get some of those jackets off her&quot; and he replied: &quot;I know, I know, I know. Germaine Greer was right on that subject.&quot;
Mr Abbott said he regretted the remark when quizzed on the Channel 9 today.
&quot;It was an off-the-cuff remark responding to an observation of a member of the public and I shouldn&apos;t have said it and I regret it,&quot; he said.
The latest verbal gaffe came just a week after Mr Abbott apologised in parliament for inappropriately saying Ms Gillard and the leader of the House of Representatives, Anthony Albanese, were &quot;walking around with targets on their foreheads&quot;.
Ms Roxon reminded reporters on Friday that Mr Abbott had abused Bernie Banton when he was dying from asbestos-induced fibrosis, and had &quot;happily&quot; swore at her (Ms Roxon) after a debate at the National Press Club.
&quot;This is Mr Abbott losing control and perhaps being under more pressure than he has been under in a while,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I also think this is Mr Abbott who needs a lesson on personal politics 101 which is, if your wife or girlfriend says, &apos;Does my bum look big in this?&apos; you say, &apos;No&apos; and get on with it.&quot;
She didn&apos;t think it was appropriate for anyone to comment on the prime minister&apos;s clothing, including Ms Greer.
&quot;Germaine Greer really didn&apos;t do herself proud in making those comments,&quot; she said.
Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten agreed, saying it was a case of an iconic feminist having a crack at another successful woman.
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have said what Tony Abbott said, it was just ridiculous,&quot; Mr Shorten told Channel 7.
Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey told the same program it was a &quot;no-go area&quot; for any male to talk about female clothing.
But he told Fairfax radio that the way one dresses and presents themselves does matter because it forms part of the judgment made of an individual.
&quot;For example, I can say to you, with absolute confidence, that you&apos;re unlikely to see me in Speedos,&quot; he said.
But he said both Ms Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan had said some &quot;nasty things&quot; about him in the past.
&quot;For me it&apos;s water off a duck&apos;s back. It&apos;s no revelation that I&apos;m a fully sized guy,&quot; he said.
&quot;Frankly when you pass comment about someone&apos;s weight or something like that I think it says more about you than it does about them.&quot;</TEXT>

<TI>the lowdown; How lifestyle changes and supplements can improve blood pressure</TI>
<TEXT>When it comes to preventing or treating high blood pressure, most of my clients prefer to try nonpharmaceutical therapies first, if possible. And for those who are already taking blood-pressure medications, making lifestyle changes may allow them
to decrease or even discontinue the drugs.
Last week, I covered the ins and outs of low-sodium diets, but nutritional strategies to manage blood pressure go far beyond simply limiting salt intake. Modifying lifestyle factors like diet and exercise, along with incorporating nutritional
supplements, can make a significant impact.
Priority No. 1: Lose weight. If you&apos;re heavy, shedding just 10 pounds can lower blood pressure enough to make it possible to reduce dosages of blood pressure medication.
Exercise also plays a key role in achieving healthy blood-pressure levels. Not only can it help with weight loss, but physical activity also provides a natural diuretic effect through sweating, says Dr. Carl Lavie, medical director of cardiac
rehabilitation and prevention at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute. &quot;Exercise alone can lower blood pressure, independently of the impact that it has on body weight,&quot; says Lavie, who recommends 30 to 45 minutes of moderate-intensity physical
activity (e.g. brisk walk, jog or bike ride) most days of the week.
Weight loss and exercise have been shown to reduce blood pressure, and the reduction is even more pronounced when combined with a lower-sodium diet that&apos;s rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy and whole grains.
Alcohol influences blood pressure as well. Consuming more than three drinks per day is linked to a higher incidence of high blood pressure, and reducing alcohol intake seems to lower it. Also keep in mind that moderate alcohol consumption (defined
as not more than one drink a day for women; two for men) also has a protective effect, decreasing our risk of cardiovascular disease as well as type 2 diabetes.
In addition to weight loss, exercise, and a nutrient-dense diet, six key nutrients have been identified as key factors in lowering blood pressure:
Potassium: Supplementing with potassium has been shown to moderately reduce blood pressure, with the greatest benefit appearing to be for people with low potassium levels, high daily sodium intakes, and for African Americans. But don&apos;t rush out to
buy over-the-counter potassium supplements. The bad news is that a typical dose of potassium used in studies is about 1870 to 3500 mg daily, but you won&apos;t find more than 99 mg of potassium in an over-the-counter supplement.
&quot;The FDA placed this limit on potassium in dietary supplements years ago,&quot; says Sal Scaccia, Pharm.D., pharmacist and owner of Total Life Care Pharmacy in Harvey. &quot;Too much potassium can be dangerous, potentially leading to heart issues such as
heart attack if levels get too high, so it&apos;s important for patients to have their blood levels monitored by a physician if they&apos;re taking large doses of potassium. Prescription dosages of potassium are most commonly 750 mg and 1500 mg, much higher than
in over-the-counter preparations,&quot; Scaccia says.
The good news is that increasing the potassium in your diet seems to have a benefit similar to that of high-dose supplementation, and it&apos;s easier than you might think. Bananas tend to get the most press when it comes to potassium-rich foods, with
a medium-sized banana providing about 422 mg. Yet a cup of red beans packs in more than 700 mg of potassium, a cup of cooked mushrooms has just over 550 mg, and a cup of milk contains about 450 mg. The potassium content of coconut water ranges from 290
to 550 mg per cup, and a 6-ounce carton of low-fat plain Greek yogurt provides 250 mg.
Calcium: Supplementing with 1000 to 1500 mg calcium daily has been linked to a slight drop in blood pressure, with the benefits appearing to be more significant in people with a low dietary intake of calcium. And women 45 and older who have a
higher intake of calcium (from both diet and supplements) seem to have a lower risk of developing hypertension compared to women with a lower calcium intake.
It&apos;s possible to get this level of calcium through diet alone (yogurt, milk, calcium-fortified milk alternatives, cheese, fortified cereals and leafy greens can easily add up to 1500 mg, and many of these foods have the added benefit of being rich
in potassium, as well), or through a combination of diet and supplementation.
Fish oil: Supplementing with fish oil has been shown to modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension, with studies using either 4 grams of fish oil, or fish oil supplements that provide about 2 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) and 1.4 grams of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) daily. It&apos;s almost impossible to get these levels from diet alone.
Soy protein: A daily dose of 40 grams of soy protein appears to cause a significant drop in blood pressure. This level of soy protein is typically accomplished by using a protein powder, although it can also be achieved with soy products like soy
milk, tofu and edamame. High doses of soy aren&apos;t recommended for women with a personal or family history of hormone receptive positive breast cancer, however, because of the estrogen-like effects of soy&apos;s isoflavones.
Chocolate: Cocoa is one of the top food sources of flavonoids, which are antioxidant-rich plant-based compounds. Consuming 400 to 500 mg daily of cocoa flavonoids has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure -- great news, except for the
fact that this translates to about 3.5 ounces (and 500-plus calories) of chocolate daily, which unfortunately is not recommended for the majority of us.
Better bets: Flavonol-enhanced cocoa, like CocoaVia (each 30-calorie stick pack provides 350 mg of cocoa flavonols to stir into coffee, milk, or protein shakes) or CocoaWell capsules with 450 mg of flavonols per serving.
Coenzyme Q10: Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like compound present in virtually all of our cells. Supplementing with Q10 (100 to 200 mg divided into two to three doses) has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure; in some cases enough to
warrant the reduction or discontinuation of blood-pressure medications.
Unlike the previously mentioned nutrients, CoQ10 is only found in very small quantities in food, so supplementation is needed to achieve these high levels.
Check with your physician and pharmacist before beginning a supplement regime, particularly if you&apos;re taking medications, to ensure that there are no adverse effects. Don&apos;t change medication dosages without consulting your doctor.
It&apos;s important to work with your health-care team to find the best combination of diet, exercise, supplements and medication that works for you.</TEXT>

<TI>Record kidney cancer toll because of obesity</TI>
<TEXT>BRITAIN&apos;S obesity crisis has driven levels of kidney cancer to a record high, new figures show.
The number of cases diagnosed each year in Britain has soared to just over 9,000 for the first time.
This represents a huge increase of 135 per cent over the past 35 years, the figures from Cancer Research UK reveal.
Experts believe obesity is fuelling the crisis. Being dangerously overweight can increase the risk of developing kidney cancer by 70 per cent. In 1975 there were 3,000 cases and it was the 14th most common cancer in Britain. But the numbers have
been steadily rising ever since.
The latest figures make it now the country&apos;s eighth most common cancer.
Professor Tim Eisen, based at Cambridge University, said: &quot;Over the last 10 years, Cancer Research UK has helped to develop new drugs which destroy the blood supply to the kidney cancers.
&quot;These drugs control the disease in most patients but do not cure it.
&quot;It is best to prevent the problem in the first place. Maintaining a healthy weight and not smoking are the best ways of doing that. The other important point is to see your doctor if you have noticed blood in your urine as this can be an early
sign of something wrong.
&quot;If the kidney cancer is caught early, it can often be cured by surgery.&quot;
Some of the increase is believed to be due to more widespread use of imaging techniques which help diagnose more kidney tumours.
But evidence from other studies shows there has also been a rise in the number of advanced kidney cancer cases detected - suggesting other factors are also in play.
Smoking After smoking, obesity is one of the main risk factors.
Cancer Research UK figures estimate that a quarter of cases in men and 22 per cent in women are linked to being overweight.
Smoking and obesity together are estimated to account for 42 per cent of all UK kidney cancer cases.
Overweight people produce higher levels of certain hormones than those of a healthy size and this can contribute to an increased risk of several types of cancer including kidney.
types of cancer including kidney. Whereas smoking rates are falling, obesity is on the rise.
Whereas smoking rates are falling, BBC newscaster Nicholas Owen, 65, a kidney cancer survivor, said: &quot;It&apos;s worrying to see the number of cases rise. It is so important for people to go to their doctor if they experience any symptoms like blood in
urine.
&quot;The chances are it won&apos;t be cancer but if it is, spotting it early means that treatment is often easier and many &quot;The chances are it won&apos;t be cancer but if it is, spotting it early means that treatment is often easier and many more people

<TI>Your child&apos;s milk tooth can save her life</TI>
<TEXT>New Delhi, March 30 (IANS) Is your child about to lose her milk tooth? Instead of throwing it away, you can now opt to use it to harvest stem cells in a dental stem cell bank for future use in the face of serious ailments. Now that&apos;s a tooth fairy
story coming to life.
Still relatively new in India, dental stem cell banking is fast gaining popularity as a more viable option over umbilical cord blood banking.
Stem cell therapy involves a kind of intervention strategy in which healthy, new cells are introduced into a damaged tissue to treat a disease or an injury.
&quot;The umbilical cord is a good source for blood-related cells, or hemaotopoietic cells, which can be used for blood-related diseases, like leukaemia (blood cancer). Having said that, blood-related disorders constitute only four percent of all
diseases,&quot; Shailesh Gadre, founder and managing director of the company Stemade Biotech, told IANS.
&quot;For the rest of the 96 percent tissue-related diseases, the tooth is a good source of mesenchymal (tissue-related) stem cells. These cells have potential application in all other tissues of the body, for instance, the brain, in case of diseases
like Alzheimer&apos;s and Parkinson&apos;s; the eye (corneal reconstruction), liver (cirrhosis), pancreas (diabetes), bone (fractures, reconstruction), skin and the like,&quot; he said.
Mesenchymal cells can also be used to regenerate cardiac cells.
Dental stem cell banking also has an advantage when it comes to the process of obtaining stem cells.
&quot;Obtaining stem cells from the tooth is a non-invasive procedure that requires no surgery, with little or no pain. A child, in the age group of 5-12, is any way going to lose his milk tooth. So when it&apos;s a little shaky, it can be collected with
hardly any discomfort,&quot; Savita Menon, a pedodontist, said.
&quot;Moreover, in a number of cases, when an adolescent needs braces, the doctor recommends that his pre-molars be removed. These can also be used as a source for stem cells. And over and above that, an adult&apos;s wisdom tooth can also be used for the
same purpose,&quot; Gadre added.
Therefore, unlike umbilical cord blood banking which gives one just one chance - during birth - the window of opportunity in dental stem cell banking is much bigger.
&quot;Of course, age is still a big factor,&quot; added Menon. &quot;A child&apos;s milk tooth has more potency than a wisdom tooth. The ability of a young one&apos;s cells to multiply is twice as higher as anyone else.&quot;
Pankaj Kala is one of those who opted for dental stem cell banking for his child.
&quot;I lost my mother to cardiac arrest when she was just 45. She was also a diabetic. After that I decided that I will do everything possible to protect my family from harm. I missed the opportunity of umbilical cord blood banking in the case of my
daughter when she was born; so when she was six, we went for dental stem cell banking,&quot; Kala, who is in the jewellery business in Mumbai, told IANS.
&quot;It&apos;s been two years now and I have decided to go for the procedure for the second child too. Even my wife will go for stem cell banking using her wisdom tooth. In my case, however, it will be difficult since I had gone for root canal treatment in
my wisdom tooth and therefore it&apos;s not healthy,&quot; he added.
Anish Jain, another parent who has got his son&apos;s milk tooth extracted for stem cell banking, said: &quot;I know stem cell therapy is a relatively new field, but I didn&apos;t want to have regrets later about not doing anything that could help my child if he
suffers from any ailment.&quot;
As of now, dental stem cell banking in India is offered by a select few companies, like Stemade and Store Your Cells. The procedure and then preservation of the stem cells can cost around Rs.100,000 for a period of 21 years.
&quot;Around 20 percent of those who have come to us for dental stem cell banking are doctors,&quot; said Gadre, who added they collect 60-70 samples every month.
There are however sceptics.
&quot;Research is still on in stem cell therapy; so to tell people that harvesting your stem cells can save you from any serious disease is still a premature statement,&quot; said a doctor.

<TI>ECOLOGICAL TIERING AND THE EVOLUTION OF A STEM: THE OLDEST STEMMED FROND FROM THE EDIACARAN OF NEWFOUNDLAND, CANADA</TI>
<TEXT>ABSTRACT-
The ecological segregation of large, multicellular eukaryotes in the Ediacaran in response to competitive feeding results in the evolution of novel morphological adaptations such as sturdy stems to elevate above lower-tier feeding guilds.
Culmofrons plumosa n. gen. n. sp. lived attached to the ocean floor and probably fed osmotrophically from dissolved organic nutrients in the water column. Competition for nutrients with specialized lower-tiered organisms resulted in the evolution of a
specialized non-feeding structure, drastically expanding the functional morphospace available to Ediacaran rangeomorphs. The first appearance of a cylindrical macroscopic stem in C. plumosa in the Briscal Formation of the Mistaken Point Ecological
Reserve marks a significant departure from the modular repetitive branching typical of the Rangeomorpha, and exemplifies the importance of nutrient acquisition in early ecosystem engineering.
INTRODUCTION
THE EDIACARA biota consist of a distinctive group of large (centimeter to meter scale), soft-bodied, and morphologically-complex organisms that span the latter part (579542 Ma) of the Ediacaran Period (Knoll et al., 2006). The relationships
amongst the Ediacara biota are controversial, but likely consist of several différent clades (Xiao and Laflamme, 2009; Narbonne, 2011; Erwin et al., 2011), including stem/crown group animals (Gehling, 1991; Gehling and Rigby, 1996; Fedonkin and
Waggoner, 1997; Sperling and Vinther, 2010) and several extinct clades of large, multicellular organisms, including the Erniettomorpha (Xiao and Laflamme, 2009) and the Rangeomorpha (Jenkins, 1985; Narbonne, 2004; Narbonne et al., 2009) that may be
basal to metazoans. Rangeomorphs are modular organisms constructed from centimeter-scale elements (termed frondlets by Narbonne, 2004) consisting of at least three orders of selfrepeating or &quot;fractal&quot; (cf. Seilacher, 1992) branching. These frondlets are
assembled like building blocks into larger constructions which can deviate from the self-repeating branching pattern to build complex fronds like Avalofr actus Narbonne, Laflamme, Greentree, and Trusler 2009, cabbageshaped Bradgatia Boynton and Ford
1995, spindle-shaped Fractofusus Gehling and Narbonne 2007, or even fence-like Pectinifrons Bamforth, Narbonne, and Anderson 2008 (Narbonne, 2004; Laflamme and Narbonne, 2008a). Rangeomorphs constituted more than 75% of all the megascopic organisms and
filled most of the ecological roles in the Mistaken Point ecosystem (Clapham, et al., 2003; Bottjer and Clapham, 2006).
Rangeomorphs have been assigned to many different groups. Originally, they were considered primitive ctenophores (Gurich, 1930, 1933; see also Dzik, 2002) or cnidarians (Misra, 1969; Glaessner, 1979; Jenkins, 1985; Runnegar and Fedonkin, 1992;
Boynton and Ford, 1995) but were later found to have no morphological features characteristic of any living clade of animal (Pflug, 1972; Seilacher, 1992; Narbonne, 2004; Brasier and Antcliffe, 2004; Grazhdankin and Seilacher, 2005; Gehling and
Narbonne, 2007; Sperling et al., 2007; Laflamme and Narbonne, 2008a, 2008b; Narbonne et al., 2009). Brasier and Antcliffe (2004) proposed that several Rangeomorpha taxa such as Bradgatia and Fractofusus could represent different stages of a Charnia Ford
1958 growth cycle but this has not been supported by subsequent character-based and morphometric work by Brasier and Antcliffe (2009) and Narbonne et al. (2009), which instead suggests a phylogenetic relationship between the morpho-taxa seen worldwide.
Sperling et al. (2007) noted the absence of metazoan characters such as a water vascular system and suggested that rangeomorphs may represent stem-group opisthokonts (superkingdom that includes the animals and fungi). Regardless of their placement on
the Tree of Life, it remains that the fractal branching frondlet is unique to the Rangeomorpha and unknown from any crown Metazoa (Narbonne, 2004; Xiao and Laflamme, 2009; Erwin et al., 2011), and likely represents an effective means of increasing the
surface area to volume ratio in order to directly absorb dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the water column (osmotrophy; Sperling et al, 2007; Laflamme et al., 2009; Sperling et al., 2011). Rangeomorphs are entirely restricted to the Ediacaran, going
extinct prior to the Great Cambrian Radiation (Narbonne, 2005).
Rangeomorphs are a global group, known from the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, the White Sea region of Russia, Namibia in southern Africa, the Rocky Mountains in SW Canada, and the Avalon Zone of Newfoundland and England (Narbonne et al.,
2009; Wilby et al., 2011). The Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve, outcropping all along the southeastern coast of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, is overwhelmingly dominated, in terms of diversity, disparity, and abundance, by rangeomorphs
(Clapham et al., 2003; Bottjer and Clapham, 2006). Mistaken Point consists of a deep-ocean slope assemblage dominated by fine-grained turbidites (Wood et al., 2003). The fossils are exposed on dozens of large bedding surfaces throughout the ecological
reserve. These bedding planes were formed due to the recessive nature of overlying centimeter- to meter-thick volcanic ash beds, which blanketed, smothered and felled the local Ediacaran populations and allowed for their preservation as in situ fossil
communities. In addition to facilitating the casting and molding of these soft-bodied organisms, the volcanic ash yields zircons which have allowed for precise dating of the assemblages (Dunning in Benus, 1988; Bowring et al., 2003; van Kronendonk et
al., 2008), implying that Mistaken Point represents the oldest assemblage of Ediacaratype fossils known anywhere (Narbonne and Gehling, 2003).
Several studies have demonstrated a strong ecological signal at Mistaken Point, presumably in response to local competition for dissolved organic matter (Laflamme and Narbonne, 2008b), resulting in striking vertical subdivision of the water column
into distinct tiers (Clapham and Narbonne, 2002), and a likely successional trend as communities became more complex (Clapham et al., 2003). The late succession community at Gull Rock Cove (or &quot;Lower Mistaken Point&quot;; Wood et al., 2003; Clapham et al.,
2003) consists almost entirely of middle to upper-tier Ediacaran fronds such as Charniodiscus spinosus Laflamme, Narbonne, and Anderson 2004, Trepassia (Charnia) wardae Narbonne and Gehling 2003, and the meterlong Frondophyllas grandis Bamforth and
Narbonne 2009.
Here we describe the rangeomorph frond Culmofrons plumosa n. gen. n. sp. from the Briscal and Mistaken Point formations of the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland, Canada. Culmofrons marks a fundamental evolutionary step in rangeomorph construction,
the first appearance of a prominent sturdy stem which elevated the feeding structure higher into the water column. This fundamental shift in rangeomorph morphospace would have provided a competitive advantage over lower-tiered specialists like
Fractofusus, effectively limiting competition for nutrients by occupying a previously unoccupied niche, and represents a significant development in the evolution of tiered suspension-feeding communities.
GEOLOGIC AND STRATIGRAPHIC SETTING
Culmofrons plumosa has been reported from two horizons in the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve (Fig. 1; &quot;Charnia&quot; or &quot;Charnia B&quot; in Clapham and Narbonne, 2002; Clapham et al., 2003). The oldest specimens are from the Bristy Cove section in the
Briscal Formation (locality BC of Clapham et al., 2003), while the greatest numbers of specimens are from a surface at Gull Rock Cove at the base of the Mistaken Point Formation (locality LMP of Clapham et al., 2003). The Bristy Cove and Gull Rock Cove
sections are temporally restricted between ash beds in the Drook Formation dated at 578.8 ± 0.5 Ma (van Kronendonk et al., 2008) and an ash bed directly overlying the well-studied E-surface of the Mistaken Point Formation dated at 565 +±3Ma (Dunning in
Benus, 1988).
The Mistaken Point succession was deposited in a deepwater environment considerably below both storm wave-base and the base of the photic zone (Misra, 1971; Benus, 1988; Myrow, 1995; Narbonne et al., 2001, 2005; Wood et al., 2003). The Briscal
Formation consists of thick bedded T^sub (A)B(C)DE^ turbidites composed of gray medium- to coarse-grained sandstones with rare greenish mudstones deposited in a deep-water axial setting. The volcanic ashes responsible for Conception-style fossil
preservation (Narbonne, 2005) are sporadic and only a few millimetres thick, resulting in a unique taphonomic window in which the fossils are preserved as dark outlines scattered over the bedding surface and are only visible when wet (Narbonne et al.,
2001, 2005, 2009). The overlying Mistaken Point Formation consists mainly of thin- to medium-bedded T^sub (C)DE^ turbidites deposited in a deep-water slope or toe-of-slope setting.
The Bristy cove section is overwhelmingly dominated by the lower-tier benthic reclining Fractofusus andersoni, with a significant contribution to the overall diversity by &quot;Charnia B&quot; (of Clapham et al., 2003) which represents two distinct taxa:
the stemless Beothukis Brasier and Antcliffe 2009 and a long-stemmed form herein referred to Culmofrons plumosa. At Gull Rock Cove, over three hundred fossil specimens, most of which are fronds, have been identified on the single surface. Culmofrons was
again labeled as Charnia Type B by Clapham et al. (2003). In all cases, the fronds display a strongly preferred felling orientation towards the NE, which is interpreted as representing alignment by a contour-parallel current (Wood et al., 2003; Narbonne
et al., 2005).
TAPHONOMY
Mistaken Point organisms lived on a muddy sea bottom below storm wave-base and the photic zone. Coatings of volcanic ash covered, smothered, and felled the epibenthic fronds, and their fossils are preserved on the top surfaces of the
interturbidite beds immediately under a layer of volcanic ash (Seilacher, 1999; Conception-style preservation of Narbonne, 2005). Labile minerals within the ash allowed for rapid lithification, resulting in casts of either the top surface of the
organism itself, or its post-felling impression left in the seafloor mud and microbial mats (Gehling and Narbonne, 2007). This model predicts that least resistant (more labile) tissues, such as frond petalodia and rangeomorph frondlets, left an imprint
in the ocean bottom sediments prior to decomposition. Following being felled and buried by volcanic ash, which effectively sealed off oxygen to the organism-mat/sediment interface, the activities of sulfur reducing bacteria resulted in the precipitation
of iron sulfide coatings around the decaying carcass, which rapidly lithified to produce morphologicallyfaithful casts of the external morphology of these organisms (i.e., &quot;Death Masks&quot; of Gehling, 1999). The decay of the most labile tissues allowed ash
to fill the voids remaining after decomposition to produce negative epirelief impressions. On the other hand, tissues less prone to decomposition, such as holdfast discs and frond stems, were coated by a layer of ash which solidified prior to their
decay. After they decomposed, ocean bottom mud was injected upwards into the void and molded by the hardened layer of ash, producing positive epirelief casts.
Two large specimens of Culmofrons are well-preserved along the entire length of the specimens (Fig. 2), including evidence of fractal rangeomorph frondlets in several primary branches (arrows in Fig. 2.2, 2.3). However, in most specimens only the
discs, stems, primary branches, and proximal portions of the secondary branches were preserved. Given the discrepancy between rare, exceptionally preserved specimens and more common, moderately to poorly preserved specimens, it is possible that the
quality of preservation was directly linked to the speed at which the specimens were felled and covered with ash. This degradation of préservation distally in fronds has also been noted in Charniodiscus Ford 1958 and Charnia from the Mistaken Point
Formation (Laflamme et al., 2004, 2007).
MATERIALS AND METHOD
Two specimens of Culmofrons from Bristy Cove were photographed and an additional nine specimens from Gull Rock Cove were photographed and a latex mold taken to allow for detailed investigations in the laboratory. Specimens varied in preservational
quality and completeness, and include a presumed ontogenetic series allowing for inferences concerning the growth patterns of Culmofrons (Fig. 2). Due to legal restrictions on collecting fossils from the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve, no specimens
were collected.
Pervasive tectonic shortening is prevalent throughout the Avalon Peninsula (Seilacher, 1992; Wood et al., 2003), resulting in a 15-40% shortening of fossil dimensions in the direction of cleavage. This is most evident when evaluating the
length/width ratios of oval holdfasts in frond specimens such as Culmofrons, which are demonstrably circular in similar species from all other Ediacaran-aged deposits worldwide. Furthermore, the direction of the long axis in the deformed oval holdfasts
is consistently oriented in the same direction for all specimens on the same surface, regardless of their taxonomic affinity, size, or location on the surface (Wood et al., 2003). In order to rectify for this deformation, specimens are photographically
or mathematical restored to their original shape, a process termed retrodeformation (Wood et al., 2003). Considering that specimens of Culmofrons all possess a circular holdfast, retrodeformation can be applied to each individual specimen. All
photographs and measurements presented here (Table 1) have been retrodeformed.

Figure 2
Diagnosis. - Rangeomorph frond with a spatulate to ovate petaloid composed of few (less than five on each side) alternating primary branches forming a zigzagging central axis. Basal primary branches attach directly to a long cylindrical stem and
circular unornamented holdfast. Primary branches composed of several (between 8 to 12) sub-rectangular to trapezoidal secondary modular units oriented perpendicularly to the primary branches. Secondary modular units composed of cm-scale rangeomorph
frondlets.
Description. - Culmofrons consists of a 3.00 to 23.57 cm long (mean=12.80 cm; n=7) and 2.15 to 9.00 cm wide (mean=5.40 cm; n=7) petaloid with a 2.00 to 14.4 cm long (mean=7.47 cm; n=ll) stem and a disc with a large surface expression ranging in
diameter from 0.90 to 6.00 cm (mean= 3.71 cm; n=ll). All well-preserved petaloids are composed of 4 to 6 sigmoidal primary branches (Fig. 2) which alternately stem at acute angles from a central axis, resulting in a zigzagging midline. Primary branches
decrease in size and become more acute distally (Fig. 2), with larger proximal branches diverging from a central axis at 19° to 35° while the typically smaller distal branches diverge at 1° to 6°. The sigmoidal shape of individual primary branches is
presumed to be taphonomically controlled (see Laflamme et al., 2007), and results from both the overlapping of primary branches across the midline as branches alternate from side-to-side, and from the distal end of each branch tucking itself behind
subsequent branches. The largest primary branches are divided into 8 to 12 visible plumose secondary rangeomorph branches (Fig. 2) which stem from a location on primary branches overlapped by the neighboring distal branch. Basal secondary modular units
are almost perpendicular to the central axis of the primary branches, however this angle becomes more acute distally. Proximal primary branches typically display a higher number of visible secondary units (8-12) whereas distal branches display
significantly fewer (1-3). Isolated tertiary rangeomorph branches are visible in well-preserved specimens and are housed within the sub-rectangular secondary modules.
Discussion. - The petalodium of two well-preserved specimens of Culmofrons (Fig. 2.1, 2.2) are approximately the same length (20.43-23.57 cm) but differ relatively more in width (6.43-8.0 cm). Measurements of primary branch angles indicate that
the width of the petalodium, as well as that of individual branches, is dependent on the degree at which the primary branches diverge from a central axis (Fig. 2). This suggests that primary branches were capable of considerable lateral motion and were
only attached to the stalk at their bases. The extent of overlap with adjacent branches is dictated by the branching angles of the primary branches, and thus the sizes of the primary and secondary branches are strongly linked to their preservation.
However, despite these differences in primary branching angle, no evidence for a second half to the primary branches is seen in any part of any specimen, and therefore it is highly unlikely that the primary branches were originally double-sided.
There is a large difference in the number of secondary branches per primary branch, with the most basal primary branches typically displaying the highest number of secondary branches and the most distal primary branches typically displaying the
fewest. This trend is likely a combination of both biological and taphonomic signals. Basal primary branches are larger and likely represent the first primary branches to be constructed. Basal primary branches also have larger secondary modular units,
implying that the rangeomorph element grew mostly by inflation after the initial fractal branching, a trend previously identified by Gehling and Narbonne (2007) for Fractofusus. The most distal primary branches are significantly smaller, are more poorly
preserved, and are affected by a greater amount of overlap with adjacent primary branches, which may also explain the fewer number of secondary modular units.
Several small specimens (between 5.00 cm and 8.75 cm long) of Culmofrons occur on the Gull Rock and Bristy Cove surfaces (Fig. 2.5). Their diminutive size results in a poor preservation of the delicate petalodium, and as such they do not display
the detail visible in larger specimens. It is possible to identify the alternating primary branching pattern and a few likely secondary modular units. These specimens also possess a high-relief basal disc and a relatively long cylindrical stem.
Laflamme and Narbonne (2008a, 2008b) classified Ediacaran fronds into four distinct groups based on their branching architecture: Arborea-, Charnia-, Rangea-, and Swartpuntia-type branching, likely representing distinct taxonomic clades.
Swartpuntia-type branching is unknown from the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve and consists of unbranching cylindrical tubular units with no similarity to the fractal architecture of Culmofrons.
The presence of secondary sub-rectangular modular units housing fractal rangeomorph frondlets in Culmofrons is different from Arborea-type branching of Charniodiscus. Furthermore, the significantly fewer number of primary branches in Culmofrons
irrespective of size also consistently distinguishes it from Charniodiscus (Laflamme et al., 2004). Rangea- and Charnia-type branching is hypothesized to represent a major division within the higher-order Rangeomorpha (Fig. 3; Narbonne et al., 2009).
Rangea-type branching is restricted to rangeomorph fronds in which the primary branches consist of true fractal elements with secondary branches occurring on both halves of a primary branch. As such, the primary branches are remarkably similar to the
centimeter-scale rangeomorph frondlet with secondary branches occurring on both sides of each primary branch (=&quot;doublesided rangeomorphs&quot; in Fig. 3). The secondary branches in Charnia-type branching are restricted to a single side of each primary branch
(= &quot;single-sided rangeomorphs&quot; in Fig. 3). It has been proposed that the main distinction between singlesided primary branches and double-sided primary branches represents a fundamental shift in construction, with doublesided Rangea-type primary
branching consisting of a higherorder of fractal branching whereas single-sided Charnia-type branching represents a departure from a fractal construction above the rangeomorph frondlet or secondary branch (Narbonne et al., 2009).
The primary branches of Culmofrons are single-sided, with double-sided rangeomorph frondlets restricted to the secondary modular elements (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the sigmoidal primary branches alternate and cross-over the central midline to create
a zigzagging central axis. These characteristics allow Culmofrons to be distinguished from Rangea Gürich 1930 and Avalofractus, which both display Rangea-type double-sided fractal primary branches, and suggest an affinity with the Charnida as defined by
Narbonne et al., 2009. Although the primary branching structure in Culmofrons is similar to Charnia, Trepassia, and Beothukis, Culmofrons can consistently be distinguished from these forms in possessing a long cylindrical stem. Furthermore, unlike
Charnia (Antcliffe and Brasier, 2007) and Trepassia (Narbonne et al., 2009), Culmofrons does not appear to add primary branches when constructing its petalodium, restricting its branch count to less than half a dozen (all well-preserved specimens have
no more than four). It appears as though the primary branches, once acquired, increase in size through individual growth of the fractal modular units. The number of primary branches is also helpful in differentiating Culmofrons from Beothukis, which
exhibits at least six primary branches, with several specimens possessing nine to ten primary branches. It is important to note that the overall shape of the Culmofrons frond is most similar to Avalofractus, due to the convergence in overall form in
constructing a cylindrical stem to which an ovate petaloid is attached. It has been argued that overall frond shape, consisting of a holdfast, stem, and petaloid, is a convergent trend in several Ediacara taxa and results from a shared need to extract
nutrients from the water-column (Narbonne and Laflamme, 2008a, 2008b). As such, we placed greater emphasis on frond architecture, which in Culmofrons highlights a Charnia-type branching structure most similar to Beothukis, Charnia, and Trepassia.
Primocandelabrum Hofmann, O&apos;Brien and King 2008 from the Bonavista Peninsula of Newfoundland is only partially preserved thus severely limiting the extent to which branching structure can be examined, however no rangeomorph elements are known in
any specimens of Primocandelabrum (Hofmann et al., 2008). Furthermore, Primocandelabrum^ holdfast disc is characterized by distinct appendages that radiate from the holdfast producing a Hiemalora-like disc (see fig. 12 in Hofmann et al., 2008), which
are distinctly lacking in Culmofrons. This distinction cannot be attributed to taphonomy since isolated Hiemalora discs have been reported from Gull Rock Cove (Narbonne et al., 2001; Hofmann et al., 2008).
Occurrence and stratigraphie range. - Culmofrons occurs at two stratigraphie levels in the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve (Fig. 1). The oldest specimens are known from the middle Briscal Formation at Bristy Cove, while younger specimens occur
in the lower part of the Mistaken Point Formation at Gull Rock Cove (Fossil Surface F3 in Wood et al., 2003).
Etymology. - Plumosa refers to the feather-like shape of the frond as well as the plumose nature of the rangeomorph branches within the petalodium.
Holotype. - The ecological reserve status at Mistaken Point prevents any specimen collection, however previous studies (Hofmann et al., 2008; Brasier and Antcliffe, 2009; Bamforth and Narbonne, 2009) have designated a field holotype and a
corresponding plaster or latex type reposited in a museum. Royal Ontario Museum Plastotype ROM 61522 (Fig. 2.2) from the Mistaken Point Formation at Gull Rock Cove in southeast Newfoundland has a 23.57 cm long and 8.0 cm wide petalodium, with a 10.0 cm
long stem and a 5.0 cm diameter holdfast.
Three-dimensional reconstruction. - The nature of Conception-style preservation is such that originally three-dimensional organisms are cast by beds of volcanic ash as twodimensional impressions on the top surfaces of bedding planes. As such,
taphonomic clues in addition to direct morphological evidence must be incorporated into any threedimensional reconstructions (Laflamme et al., 2007; Narbonne et al., 2009). Characters preserved in positive epirelief, such as the cylindrical stems and
circular holdfasts, suggest that these tissues were more resistant to decomposition (Seilacher, 1992, 1999; Narbonne, 2005). On the other hand, rangeomorph frondlets are preserved in negative epirelief, presumed to have been formed in response to the
collapse/decomposition of the labile tissue, thus allowing the overlying ashbeds to infill the void (Narbonne, 2005; Gehling and Narbonne, 2007).
In two dimensions the petalodium appears to be a single sheet-like structure but taphonomic features suggest otherwise. The difference in primary branching angle in specimens dictates the shape of the petalodium (Fig. 2). Petalodia of specimens
with high primary branching angles appear streamlined and elongated whereas specimens with lower primary branching angles are distinctly wider. The variation in primary branching angle is apparent in all specimens studied. This implies that primary
branches were strongly anchored at their proximal bases and only loosely attached (if at all) at their distal tips. This results in a high degree of lateral motility in the primary branches, varying degrees of primary branch overlap and bundling, and
ultimately varying widths of the petalodium. The taphomorphology of the petalodium, or the apparent shape differences resulting from preservational variations, changes with differing amounts of overlap and is governed by primary branching angles. The
primary branching angle also dictates the extent to which secondary branches are revealed in two dimensions and thus their apparent shape, a trend also evident in Charnia (Laflamme et al., 2007).
TIERING AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STEM
One of the most striking features of the Mistaken Point assemblage is the distinct tiering component resulting from direct competition between organisms for particulates or dissolved nutrients within the water column (Clapham and Narbonne, 2002).
In the absence of prédation, ecological competition associated with nutrient sequestration led to distinct speciation events (Laflamme et al., 2004), expansion of functional morphospace (Laflamme and Narbonne, 2008b), and ultimately ecosystem complexity
and succession (Clapham et al., 2003). Culmofrons is striking in representing the first rangeomorph frond with a prominent cylindrical stem, and its first appearance in conjunction with the first appearance of dedicated lower-tiered specialists like
Fractofusus (Gehling and Narbonne, 2007) and Bradgatia (Flude and Narbonne, 2008) in the Briscal Formation suggests that direct competition for nutrients above the sediment-water interface started an ecological escalation leading to complex ecological
tiering and communities strikingly similar to those exhibited by suspension feeders living on modern slopes (Clapham and Narbonne, 2002; Clapham et al., 2003).
Prior to the advent of Culmofrons, Ediacaran fronds such as Charnia and Trepassia shared certain distinct features, including the continual addition of modular primary branches resulting in longer fronds which fed along the entire length of the
petalodium (Antcliffe and Brasier, 2007; Laflamme et al., 2007; Narbonne et al., 2009). The distinct absence of a stem, coupled with the remarkable preservation of &gt;2 meter long fronds beneath mm-thick layers of volcanic ash suggests that the fronds
were lying perpendicular to the seafloor, only a few centimeters above the sediment-water interface. As the deepocean unidirectional currents transported dissolved organic nutrients along the entire length of the frond, the high surfacearea to volume
ratio of the fractal rangeomorph elements would adsorb nutrients which diffused through the integument via osmosis. The fractal elements may also have caused minor disruptions in the laminar flow in the deep-water unidirectional currents, resulting in
micro-vortices which aided in the transfer of nutrients across the boundary layer. This mode of life was ideal until the appearance of lower-tier specialist such as Fractofusus and Bradgatia in the Briscal Formation. These represent a fundamentally
different construction that focused on building a fixed number of rangeomorph elements which inflated in size throughout ontogeny. Although inflating the fractal element naturally results in a lower surface area to volume ratio (Laflamme et al., 2009),
the net increase in overall surface area, combined with a greater spacing between each fractal division throughout the rangeomorph element (e.g., exposing more surface area directly to the water column), results in an ideal construction for lower-tiered
osmotrophs. It has also been suggested, based on detailed taphonomic studies of thousands of specimens at Mistaken Point, that Fractofusus may have had a petaloid sticking upwards into the water-column, resulting in a three-veined &quot;&quot; shape (Gehling and
Narbonne, 2007).
Culmofrons can be compared to Phanerozoic primary solitary tierers of Bottjer and Ausich (1986). All complete large specimens of Culmofrons occur in the 22-35 cm tier of Clapham and Narbonne (2002). The primary branches of Culmofrons are flexible
and are only anchored to the central stalk and therefore not attached to one another, presumably allowing for water currents to flow through the individual branches. As is the case with Charniodiscus procerus Laflamme, Narbonne, and Anderson 2004, the
long stem elevated the petalodium above competitive lower tiers (Laflamme et al., 2004), and as such did not require as large of a petalodium when compared to stemless forms which fed closer to the sediment-water interface and/or fed along the entire
length of the organism. It is interesting to note that, unlike Charniodiscus, which has a worldwide distribution and dominates shallow-water assemblages, Culmofrons is restricted to deep-water assemblages. Similar trends in the distribution of Charnia
were interpreted (Laflamme et al., 2007) as evidence that limited branch motility was necessary for effective feeding in shallow-water environments.
Ecological succession has been proposed to explain the differences in tiering, disparity, and species abundances between distinct fossil horizons at Mistaken Point, with each individual bed providing a snapshot of different ecological stages of
succession (Clapham et al., 2003). The Gull Rock Cove surface is typical of a late succession stage community with a lower diversity and evenness when compared to midsuccession communities, and where vertical partitioning of the water column is
well-developed (Clapham et al., 2003). The surface is dominated by fronds and displays a tolerance model of succession where organisms adapted to higher resource levels are progressively replaced by those adapted to lower resource levels (Clapham et
al., 2003). This suggests that Culmofrons was perhaps adapted to lower resource levels.
CONCLUSIONS
Culmofrons plumosa was the first Ediacaran frond to attach its petalodium to its holdfast using a long stem, and thus the first Ediacaran frond to extend into upper feeding tiers in the water column. The petalodium is divided into a few primary
branches that alternate to form a zigzagging central midline. The petalodium of Culmofrons shares branching characteristics with organisms displaying Charnia-type branching consisting of secondary rangeomorph frondlets housed within semi-rectangular
secondary modular elements occurring on one side of a primary branch. The primary branches in Culmofrons were flexible and were only anchored proximally to the stalk.
Culmofrons lived epifaunally, attached to the ocean floor and diffusively fed from dissolved organic nutrients in the water column. Its long stem elevated its petalodium higher into the water column as a direct result of competition with
specialized lower-tiered organisms.

<TI>Two business owners vie for RGC commission seat</TI>
<TEXT>March 30--RIO GRANDE CITY -- Two local business owners say they can help move the city forward if they are elected to the city commission.
Dave &quot;Chachi&quot; Jones, a private investigator who owns a bail bonds company, is running against Juan &quot;Andy&quot; Hernandez, a home healthcare nurse and business owner, for the Place 4 Rio Grande City Commission seat. That seat will be left vacant by
Ruben D. Saenz, who is running to keep his appointed County Commission seat. City Commissioner Rey Ramirez is up for re-election, but no one filed to run against him.
Jones is running on a slate with Mayor Ruben Villarreal with support from Ramirez. Hernandez is running independently.
Jones, 42, has run for several other local elections, including county clerk, district clerk and city commission. Jones said he has gained experience from his losses. He also served as a Starr County Democratic Party precinct chair. He previously
ran as an independent and said he appreciates the support he will receive from running on a slate.
&quot;Running independently in Starr County is a long shot. Been there, done that,&quot; he said, adding that running with a slate is going to &quot;get me over that hurdle to finally be a public servant to the community.&quot;
Hernandez, 30, has served as the president of the former Greater Rio Grande City Chamber of Commerce, as the vice president of the Rio Grande City Main Street Program and with other philanthropic organizations, but he has never run for office. He
also owns a Star Communication store and Underground World Tattoo Studio.
&quot;I&apos;m not for owing favors at the end of the day,&quot; he said of his decision to run independently. &quot;I am something new. I am something fresh. I have a lot of ideas.&quot;
Hernandez said he can use his experience in the medical and business fields to try to bring more medical facilities to the area as well as educate the public about common health problems, such as diabetes.
He and Jones agree that they want to bring more business to the area.
Jones, a father of two who owns Chachi&apos;s Bail Bonds, said he wants to bring more jobs to the area to retain talented youth.
&quot;I want to ...have our kids come back after college come back and establish themselves in Rio Grande City other than them leaving and having to find jobs somewhere else,&quot; he said.
Hernandez said he thinks the city should try to bring more businesses up from Mexico.
The two city commission seats will not be the only places on the May 12 ballot. Local business owner Arturo Lopez is challenging Villarreal for his mayoral seat.

<TI>PRESS DIGEST-New York Times business news - March 30</TI>
<TEXT>March 30 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories on the New York Times business pages on Friday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.
* A breach of computers belonging to companies in Japan and India and to Tibetan activists has been linked to a former graduate student at a Chinese university - putting a face on the persistent espionage by Chinese hackers against foreign
companies and groups.
* At a time of plunging DVD sales and an up-and-down box office, Hollywood is doubling back on past hits in search of profits. Often the remakes feature familiar stars playing iconic roles, like Bruce Willis, 57, who is preparing for yet another
&quot;Die Hard&quot; film, his fifth.
* Responding to a critical investigation of its factories, the manufacturing giant Foxconn has pledged to sharply curtail working hours and significantly increase wages inside Chinese plants making electronic products for Apple and others. The
move could improve working conditions across China.
* Despite a tumultuous 2011, fees helped hedge fund managers at larger hedge firms make $14.4 billion.
* Moody&apos;s Investors Service, one of the two big ratings agencies, has said it will decide in mid-May whether to lower its ratings for 17 global financial companies. Morgan Stanley , which was hit hard in the financial crisis, appears to be the
most vulnerable. Moody&apos;s is threatening to cut the bank&apos;s ratings by three notches, to a level that would be well below the rating of a rival like JPMorgan Chase.
* A plan to impose a tax on hot take-away food while lowering income taxes on millionaires brings back memories of other unpopular measures imposed by the government.
* Jim Flaherty, the finance minister of Canada, pronounced a death sentence on the country&apos;s penny during his budget speech on Thursday.
The government estimated that every penny costs it about 1.6 cents to produce. Eliminating the penny&apos;s production will reduce the government&apos;s costs by about 11 million Canadian dollars a year.
* Representatives of advertising companies, Internet sites and technology companies told a House subcommittee on Thursday that they thought Internet privacy policies, including Do Not Track options, should be created through an &quot;open and
transparent&quot; process, as two government agencies have recommended.
* Two candidates from developing nations are challenging the American nominee, a move that reflects the fast-growing clout of emerging economies.
For the first time, the World Bank is considering more than one candidate for its five-year presidency - a change that reflects the fast-growing clout of emerging economies, even as it raises questions over whether that change is coming quickly
enough.
* An advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration said obesity drugs should get extra testing to ensure against heart attacks and strokes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>* T-DM1 superior to Tykerb plus Xeloda in Phase III study
* Filing planned for Europe and U.S. this year
* T-DM1 delivers toxic payload with fewer side effects
(Adds analyst comment, peak sales forecast)
ZURICH, March 30 (Reuters) - Roche said patients with an aggressive type of breast cancer lived longer after taking its experimental &quot;armed antibody&quot; drug without the disease worsening than those on a mix of GlaxoSmithKline drug Tykerb and Roche&apos;s
Xeloda.
The positive results from the first Phase III trial of the medicine - dubbed T-DM1 - clears the way for it to be submitted to European and U.S. authorities for approval this year, boosting prospects for a key asset in the Swiss firm&apos;s pipeline.
WestLB analyst Oliver Kaemmerer, who sees peak sales potential for T-DM1 of around 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion), said the latest news was clearly positive but it remained to be seen what the overall magnitude of the benefit was in the
study.
In a brief statement on Friday, Roche revealed only that patients on T-DM1 lived &quot;significantly longer&quot; without their disease progressing.
Roche has been developing T-DM1 with ImmunoGen as a successor to its blockbuster Herceptin, which is expected to generate sales of around $6 billion this year.
A key advantage of T-DM1 over Herceptin is the fact that it causes fewer adverse side effects like hair loss and low white blood cell counts.
It combines trastuzumab, an antibody and the active ingredient in Herceptin, with the agent DM1 - a derivative of an extremely powerful type of chemotherapy called maytansine - which is carried directly into cells.
As well as having fewer unpleasant side effects, Roche believes its new drug also offers greater convenience, since it is one drug and eliminates the need to administer chemotherapy.
Analyst hopes for T-DM1 have been running high, following earlier good results in Phase II tests, and a filing of the product with regulators this year had been widely expected on the back of data from the so-called EMILIA clinical trial.
Roche said the EMILIA progression-free survival data would be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, adding that final results for overall survival were not yet mature.
Kaemmerer of WestLB believes the full set of results for progression-free survival are likely to be presented at the June 1-5 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, with overall survival results becoming available by 2014.
Commercially, T-DM1 should help protect Roche&apos;s breast cancer franchise, since Herceptin could be exposed to so-called &quot;biosimilar&quot; generic competition in Europe from around 2015.
It also keeps Roche in the breast cancer innovation race in the face of newer medicines that aim to rival Herceptin, like GSK&apos;s Tykerb. ($1 = 0.9073 Swiss francs)

<TEXT>Remember the drunk stumbling around under the street lamp? He&apos;s lost his car keys. Asked if that&apos;s where he lost them, he replies no, he mislaid them in the dark - this is where the light is. Let&apos;s draw a lesson from this old tale, and look beyond
existing areas of light into the darker areas from which a new world economic order is emerging.
Enthusiasts for corporate rankings know the same names appear routinely at - or near - the top. So while I was pleased to see Denmark&apos;s Novo Nordisk head the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations table - published by Canadian magazine Corporate
Knights - it seemed another turn of an overly familiar wheel. Thankfully, the world&apos;s leading insulin supplier has moved well beyond its still rare incorporation of triple bottom-line principles (people, planet and profit) into its charter.
But for less-known sustainability champions, look elsewhere. A report published for the 2012 World Economic Forum was subtitled The New Sustainability Champions. Prepared by BCG, it spotlights 16 companies in countries such as Brazil, Costa Rica,
Egypt and Kenya. The conclusion? Such businesses &quot;tend to grow faster and have higher-than-average margins for their industries&quot;. But how? By turning constraints into opportunities, embedding sustainability into their cultures, and actively shaping
their business environments.
Under the first heading, they confront natural resources constraints directly, educating customers on improving efficiency and providing ways for poorer people to access products and services. When it comes to embedding values, they define clear
goals, galvanising the entire organisation; they integrate sustainability into their operations; and they engage their workforces.
Finalty, they shape policies, standards and behaviours. China&apos;s Broad Group has developed a miniature device for measuring air pollution that fits inside a mobile phone. By putting air quality information into citizens&apos; hands, they usefully
amplify societal pressure for change.

<TI>Breakfast club; L.A. Unified is offering a morning meal in classrooms, not just cafeterias, to better ensure that students get something to eat</TI>
<TEXT>Amayrany Reyes ignored the yogurt but gobbled up her strawberries and nibbled her blueberry muffin. Then the bright-eyed third-grader, sporting a pink bow in her long braid, delivered the verdict on breakfast in her Los Angeles classroom.
&quot;Everything is good,&quot; she said, adding that the food makes her feel more energetic.
More than 200,000 students in 267 schools will enjoy such breakfast benefits in the next year under a major initiative announced Thursday by the Los Angeles Unified School District and the L.A. Fund for Public Education, a fundraising group.
The &quot;Food for Thought&quot; program, which will take morning meals into the classroom rather than just the cafeteria, is aimed at boosting the share of students who eat school breakfast from 29% to 70%, according to David Binkle, the district&apos;s food
services deputy director.
Children from low-income families -- who make up about 80% of L.A. Unified students -- are less likely to eat breakfast, according to the California Food Policy Advocates. Some parents may not be able to afford the food; others may leave for work
too early to make breakfast for their children.
Betty Carrillo, an East L.A. mother, said she has to leave for work at 5:30 a.m. and is never certain whether her older son feeds her younger one a nutritious breakfast.
Yet research has linked breakfast consumption to higher academic performance, fewer discipline problems, less obesity and reduced visits to school nurses for headaches and other ailments.
&quot;Our mothers were right: Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day,&quot; said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at the program&apos;s kick-off event at Figueroa Street Elementary School in South Los Angeles.
Similar programs have been introduced in Chicago, Houston, San Diego, Detroit and Compton as a key strategy to feed breakfast to more children, especially those in poverty.
At Figueroa Street, cameras clicked while Amayrany and two dozen classmates dug into their morning fare flanked by actress Sophia Vergara, L.A. Unified board President Monica Garcia and Supt. John Deasy.
Sadale White, who comes to school early to help deliver the pre-packed breakfast kits and lay out paper trays and place mats, said his favorite treats are strawberries and other fresh fruits.
The school has quadrupled breakfast consumption from a quarter of the students to nearly all of them since rolling out the pilot program in January. Principal Tanya Stokes-Mack said the benefits were immediately noticeable: fewer absences, tardies
and visits to the school nurse.
Although the school offered free- and reduced-price breakfasts before school, students who were late missed them and others preferred to spend the time playing rather than eating.
&quot;Now it&apos;s more of a classroom activity that students don&apos;t want to be left out of,&quot; Stokes-Mack said. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of camaraderie eating with your teacher and classmates.&quot;
In high schools and some middle schools, the district plans to set up kiosks around campus with breakfast kits that students can grab and take into class. L.A. Unified hopes eventually to expand the program to 676 campuses serving more than
500,000 students in three years. Such an expansion could bring in an estimated $23.5 million annually in federal school meal reimbursements, Binkle said.
The program marks the first initiative by the L.A. Fund, launched last year by Deasy and philanthropist Megan Chernin to raise $200 million over five years for local public schools. The foundation is providing about $200,000 to help develop
nutrition education, train teachers in ways to provide it during the 10- to 15-minute breakfast period and work with vendors to improve food quality.
&quot;It&apos;s healthy, it&apos;s good and it gives kids the boost they need in the morning,&quot; Chernin said.
Nataly Escobar, 11, would agree. The classroom breakfasts are so good the fifth-grader said she gobbles them up even though she also eats eggs and toast at home before coming to school.
&quot;If you don&apos;t eat breakfast,&quot; she said, &quot;you won&apos;t feel smart.&quot;

<TI>Novo Nordisk/Nordea: Victoza kan forsinkes 2-3 år i fedme</TI>
<TEXT>Novo Nordisks lancering af Victoza til fedmebehandling kan blive to til tre år forsinket. Det vurderer Nordea er den mulige konsekvens af, at et ekspertpanel under den amerikanske lægemiddelstyrelse, FDA, torsdag anbefalede at skærpe kravene til
kommende vægttabsmidler, rapporterer Bloomberg News. Stort set den samme holding har Jyske Bank i følge bankens chefrådgiver Michael Lyngsø. FDA-eksperterne anbefalede med stemmerne 17-6 at gennemføre hjerte-kar-studier, selv hvis der ikke er synlige
tegn på, at stoffet øger risikoen for hjerte-kar-sygdomme. Panelet anbefalede samtidig at inkludere endnu flere patienter i risikogruppen i studierne, det vil sige patienter, der lider af svær fedme og ældre og endnu sygere patienter, skriver Wall
Street Journal. FDA følger normalt indstillingerne fra ekspertpanelerne, men har det endelige ord i forhold til at udvikle de nye retningslinjer for fedmemedicin. Jakob Dalskov +45 33 30 03 35 Ritzau Finans, E-mail:finans@ritzau.dk,</TEXT>

It is proposed that the existing authorisation of the Board of Directors to increase the Companys share capital according to Article 7 (1) of the Articles of Association be extended until 30 April 2017 and that certain editorial changes be made to
adapt the authorisation to the changed registration practice of the Danish Business Authority. Article 7 of the Articles of Association shall hereafter read as follows:
Sub-Article 1
The Board of Directors shall be authorised to increase the Companys share capital by one or more issues of new shares, with the existing shareholders having a pre-emptive right to subscribe for the new shares, up to a total nominal amount of DKK

The authorisation shall remain in force up to and including 30 April 2017.

<TI>Preterm birth risk linked to longer residence in U.S.(WOMEN&apos;S HEALTH)</TI>
<TEXT>BY SHARON WORCESTER
FROM THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE SOCIETY FOR MATERNALFETAL MEDICINE
DALLAS -- Preterm birth may be related in part to potentially preventable environmental factors, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 through 2006 suggest.
Survey responses from 2,441 Hispanic women with a prior live birth show that the rate of births prior to 36 weeks&quot; gestation in Hispanic immigrants who resided in the United States for less than 10 years was 3.1%, which was significantly lower
than the 7.4% rate among those who lived in the country for more than 10 years, and the 10.1% rate among Hispanic women born in the United States (age adjusted odds ratios, 2.1 and 3.1, respectively), Dr. Radek Bukowski said at the meeting.
The findings were similar after further adjustment for factors that might affect preterm birth risk, such as age, body mass index, education, nutrition, marital status, sexual behaviors, toxic exposures, income, smoking status, diabetes, and
hypertension (fully adjusted odds ratios, 2.1 and 3.5), said Dr. Bukowski of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
One factor language spoken at home--did appear to have a modifying effect on the association between length of residence in the United States and the risk of preterm birth, however.
&quot;Compared with women who lived in the United States less than 10 years, those who lived here 10 years or longer and those who were born in the United States had the highest risk if they predominantly or exclusively spoke Spanish at home,&quot; Dr.
Bukowski said.
Also, body mass index was negatively associated with preterm birth, and hypertension was positively associated with preterm birth, but these were not found to be independent risk factors in the fully adjusted model, he said.
Although nongenetic environmental factors have been thought to play a role in preterm birth risk, it has not been clear whether risk is predominantly related to genetic or environmental factors. However, many immigrants are known to have a lower
risk, which could be related to better diet and health status, he said.
Although limited by the study&apos;s cross-sectional design, the current findings suggest that risk is acquired with residence in the United States.
Given this, as well as the fact that preterm birth was not associated with a number of other risk factors in this study, it is possible that the level of risk is modifiable, Dr. Bukowski concluded.

<TI>Urate-lowering drugs often underused in gout.(MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS)</TI>
<TEXT>SNOWMASS, COLO. -- A disturbing proportion of gout cases are mismanaged, according to one prominent gout expert.
&quot;The cause and pathophysiology are well understood, we can make the diagnosis with absolute certainty, and we&apos;ve got great medicines. Yet today we all see people with tophi. That&apos;s tragic. It shouldn&apos;t exist.&quot; Having a tophus is bad. It&apos;s eroding
cartilage and bone, and that&apos;s something we can prevent if we start urate-lowering therapy soon enough,&quot; Dr. Robert L. Wortmann said at the conference.
An estimated 8.3 million Americans have gout. Yet, the pharmaceutical industry says 3.1 million of them are prescribed urate-lowering drugs. Five different studies show that 40% of those on allopurinol are prescribed a dose sufficient to drive
serum uric acid below 6 mg/dL, which is a key tenet of gout management, noted Dr. Wortmann, professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H.
Moreover, poor treatment adherence is a huge problem in gout. A study of close to 4,200 gout patients started on urate-lowering drug therapy found that 56% of them were nonadherent (Arthritis Res. Ther. 2009;11:R46).
Dr. Wortmann offered these take home points for managing gout patients:
* Don&apos;t prescribe urate-lowering drugs for asymptomatic hyperuricemia: This practice hasn&apos;t been shown to prevent the future development of gout, yet it exposes patients to the risk of drug toxicities.
* But don&apos;t ignore asymptomatic hyperuricemia, either: Epidemiologic studies have linked asymptomatic hyperuricemia, defined by a serum urate in excess of 6.8 mg/dL, to increased risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
kidney disease, and all-cause mortality. The big unanswered question is whether using medications to lower serum urate in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia reduces the risk of any of these conditions. That&apos;s the subject of ongoing large
clinical trials in high-risk patients. If those studies prove positive, clinical practice will change.
While awaiting the outcome of the prevention trials, it&apos;s worth bearing in mind that Framingham Heart Study data indicate that individuals with a serum uric acid level above 9 mg/dL have a 22% chance of developing gout within the next 5 years. The
major contributors to asymptomatic hyperuricemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heavy consumption of fructose-containing beverages or alcohol Those issues should be addressed*
Losartan is the only antihypertensive agent that&apos;s uricosuric. Fenofibrate is the sole uricosuric drug indicated for dyslipidemia. Preferential consideration could be given to the use of these drugs in hypertensive and/or hyperlipidemic patients
with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.
* The important thing is not which oral agent you use for treatment of acute gout, it&apos;s to initiate therapy as early as possible, at the first hint of an attack. Colchicine, maximum-dose NSAIDs, and oral prednisone dosed at 20 mg BID until
symptoms have been gone for 1 week followed by another week at 20 mg/day--they&apos;re all effective. And since they work by different mechanisms, they can beneficially be combined in refractory patients.
The old-school colchicine dosing regimen most physicians were taught has been cast aside of late. It had a high rate of diarrhea, an &quot;inhumane side effect&quot; in gout patients hobbled by a foot too sore to walk on, Dr. Wortmann said. The former
regimen has been replaced by 1.2 mg, given in a single dose, followed by 0.6 mg 1 hour later.
&quot;This lower dose is just as effective as the old high-dose regimen of two 0.6-mg pills given at once and then one per hour for the next 5 hours. And the lower-dose program has the same side effect profile as placebo,&quot; Dr. Wortmann said.
* Get the gout patient&apos;s serum urate below 6 mg/dL using the lowest effective dose of the urate-lowering drug you&apos;ve selected. Physicians have traditionally started gout patients on allopurinol at the standard dose of 300 mg/day. Recently, it has
been demonstrated that the risk of developing allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome is greatly reduced by starting off at 150 mg/day, checking the urate level 2 weeks later, then increasing to 300 mg/day if the serum urate isn&apos;t below 6 mg/dL. After 2
weeks at 300 rag/day, check the urate again, and if it still isn&apos;t below 6 mg/dL then bump the dose to 400 mg/day. Continue testing and titrating every 2 weeks until the serum urate is less than 6 mg/dL--and preferably less than 4 mg/dL if the patient
has tophi--or until the maximum approved dose of 800 mg/day is reached.
The same start-low-and-titrate strategy applies to febuxostat, with a maximum approved dose of 80 mg/day.
&quot;Check the serum urate after starting therapy, and if it&apos;s not below 6 mg/dL, increase the dose,&quot; the rheumatologist said.
Fortunately, patients who have a hypersensitivity reaction to allopurinol are very unlikely to experience one with febuxostat, and vice versa.
For patients who can&apos;t reach the target serum urate with maximum-dose therapy, take heart: Second-line agents with impressive potency are well-along in the developmental pipeline.
Many labs now list the upper limit of normal for serum urate as 8 mg/dL or 8.5 mg/dL. Dr. Wortmann advised Ignore that ceiling.
This raised ceiling is simply the result of the changing demographics among the increasingly obese U.S. population in the last several decades. The definition of asymptomatic hyperuricemia remains unchanged: a serum urate greater than 6.8 mg/dL.
And the target in patients with gout is still a serum urate less than 6 mg/dL. Merely dropping a gout patient&apos;s urate from 10 to 8 or even 6.6 mg/dL isn&apos;t doing any favors; the disease will continue to progress if the urate is above 6 mg/dL.
* All gout is tophaceous. Even if tophi aren&apos;t apparent on clinical examination, often they are radiographically. &quot;This is a message that has to get out,&quot; Dr. Wortmann insisted.
Gout management guidelines proposed by the American College of Rheumatology call for starting urate-lowering drug therapy when a patient is experiencing three attacks per year. Dr. Wortmann takes issue with that.
&quot;I would argue that once you&apos;ve had a third attack of gout, period, you should be treated. Maybe even sooner. We need to prevent the erosion and bony destruction that occur with tophi,&quot; he said.
One audience member complained that his gout patients with comorbid renal insufficiency and/or cardiovascular disease often get caught in a revolving door. He titrates their allopurinol to an effective dose, but when they are later admitted to the
hospital because of their comorbid conditions the hospitalists, nephrologists, or cardiologists are shocked at the allopurinol dose and either reduce it or stop it altogether. After discharge and return home, the patient eventually reappears in his
office with active gout. He then resumes their allopurinol at the previous dose, and they remain well controlled until the next hospitalization, when the same thing happens.
Urate-lowering therapy is not a one-size-fits-all matter, Dr. Wortmann said.
To get rid of gout, it&apos;s necessary to drive the serum urate to the target of less than 6 mg/dL. This will be accomplished by using the lowest effective dose.
He reported serving as a consultant to Savient, Takeda, URL Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, and Ardea Biosciences.

<TI>ALK-Abello to book EUR 3.2m gain on French DBV listing</TI>
<TEXT>(SeeNews) - Mar 30, 2012 - Danish pharma company ALK-Abello A/S (CPH:ALK B) said Thursday it will book in the first quarter of 2012 a capital gain of DKK 24 million (USD 4.3m/EUR 3.2m) after the stock listing of its associated company, French DBV
Technologies (EPA:DBV).
The French biotechnology group debuted yesterday on Euronext Paris, raising EUR 40 million (USD 53.4m) in its initial public offering (IPO), which was settled at EUR 8.86 apiece.
As ALK-Abello did not participate in the offering, its shareholding in DBV, which specialises in food allergy, was reduced to 6%.
ALK-Abello reiterated its guidance for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of over DKK 300 million for 2012.

<TI>Remarks at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee Policy Conference</TI>
<TEXT>Administration of Barack Obama, 2012
March 4, 2012
Thank you. Everyone, please have a seat. Well, good morning, everyone.
Rosy, thank you for your kind words. I have never seen Rosy on the basketball court. I&apos;ll bet it would be a treat. [Laughter] Rosy, you&apos;ve been a dear friend of mine for a long time and a tireless advocate for the unbreakable bonds between Israel
and the United States. And as you complete your term as President, I salute your leadership and your commitment.
I want to thank the board of directors. As always, I&apos;m glad to see my longtime friends in the Chicago delegation. I also want to thank the Member of Congress who are here with us today and who will be speaking to you over the next few days. You&apos;ve
worked hard to maintain the partnership between the United States and Israel. And I especially want to thank my close friend and leader of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
I&apos;m glad that my outstanding young Ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, is in the house. I understand that Dan is perfecting his Hebrew on his new assignment, and I appreciate his constant outreach to the Israeli people. And I&apos;m also pleased that
we&apos;re joined by so many Israeli officials, including Ambassador Michael Oren. And tomorrow I&apos;m very much looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Netanyahu and his delegation back to the White House.
Every time I come to AIPAC, I&apos;m especially impressed to see so many young people here. You don&apos;t yet get the front seats, I understand. [Laughter] You have to earn that. But students from all over the country who are making their voices heard and
engaging deeply in our democratic debate, you carry with you an extraordinary legacy of more than six decades of friendship between the United States and Israel. And you have the opportunity and the responsibility to make your own mark on the world. And
for inspiration, you can look to the man who preceded me on this stage, who&apos;s being honored at this conference, my friend President Shimon Peres.
Shimon was born a world away from here, in a shtetl in what was then Poland, a few years after the end of the First World War. But his heart was always in Israel, the historic homeland of the Jewish people. And when he was just a boy, he made his
journey across land and sea toward home.
In his life, he has fought for Israel&apos;s independence and he has fought for peace and security. As a member of the Haganah and a member of the Knesset, as a Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs, as a Prime Minister and as President, Shimon
helped build the nation that thrives today: the Jewish State of Israel. But beyond these extraordinary achievements, he has also been a powerful moral voice that reminds us that right makes might, not the other way around.
Shimon once described the story of the Jewish people by saying it proved that &quot;slings, arrows, and gas chambers can annihilate man, but cannot destroy human values, dignity, and freedom.&quot; And he has lived those values. He has taught us to ask more
of ourselves and to empathize more with our fellow human beings. I am grateful for his life&apos;s work and his moral example. And I&apos;m proud to announce that later this spring, I will invite Shimon Peres to the White House to present him with America&apos;s
highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
In many ways, this award is a symbol of the broader ties that bind our nations. The United States and Israel share interests, but we also share those human values that Shimon spoke about: a commitment to human dignity, a belief that freedom is a
right that is given to all of God&apos;s children, an experience that shows us that democracy is the one and only form of government that can truly respond to the aspirations of citizens.
America&apos;s Founding Fathers understood this truth, just as Israel&apos;s founding generation did. President Truman put it well, describing his decision to formally recognize Israel only minutes after it declared independence. He said: &quot;I had faith in
Israel before it was established. I believe it has a glorious future before it-as not just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.&quot;
For over six decades, the American people have kept that faith. Yes, we are bound to Israel because of the interests that we share in security for our communities, prosperity for our people, the new frontiers of science that can light the world.
But ultimately is-it is our common ideals that provide the true foundation for our relationship. That is why America&apos;s commitment to Israel has endured under Democratic and Republican Presidents and congressional leaders of both parties. In the United
States, our support for Israel is bipartisan, and that is how it should stay.
AIPAC&apos;s work continually nurtures this bond. And because of AIPAC&apos;s effectiveness in carrying out its mission, you can expect that over the next several days, you will hear many fine words from elected officials describing their commitment to the
U.S.-Israel relationship. But as you examine my commitment, you don&apos;t just have to count on my words. You can look at my deeds. Because over the last 3 years, as President of the United States, I have kept my commitments to the State of Israel. At every
crucial juncture, at every fork in the road, we have been there for Israel-every single time.
Four years ago, I stood before you and said that &quot;Israel&apos;s security is sacrosanct. It is nonnegotiable.&quot; That belief has guided my actions as President. The fact is, my administration&apos;s commitment to Israel&apos;s security has been unprecedented. Our
military and intelligence cooperation has never been closer. Our joint exercises and training have never been more robust. Despite a tough budget environment, our security assistance has increased every single year. We are investing in new capabilities.
We&apos;re providing Israel with more advanced technology, the types of products and systems that only go to our closest friends and allies. And make no mistake: We will do what it takes to preserve Israel&apos;s qualitative military edge, because Israel must
always have the ability to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.
This isn&apos;t just about numbers on a balance sheet. As a Senator, I spoke to Israeli troops on the Lebanese border. I visited with families who&apos;ve known the terror of rocket fire in Sderot. And that&apos;s why, as President, I have provided critical
funding to deploy the Iron Dome system that has intercepted rockets that might have hit homes and hospitals and schools in that town and in others. Now our assistance is expanding Israel&apos;s defensive capabilities so that more Israelis can live free from
the fear of rockets and ballistic missiles. Because no family, no citizen, should live in fear.
And just as we&apos;ve been there with our security assistance, we&apos;ve been there through our diplomacy. When the Goldstone report unfairly singled out Israel for criticism, we challenged it. When Israel was isolated in the aftermath of the flotilla
incident, we supported them. When the Durban conference was commemorated, we boycotted it, and we will always reject the notion that Zionism is racism.
When one-sided resolutions are brought up at the Human Rights Council, we oppose them. When Israeli diplomats feared for their lives in Cairo, we intervened to save them. When there are efforts to boycott or divest from Israel, we will stand
against them. And whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the State of Israel, my administration has opposed them. So there should not be a shred of doubt by now: When the chips are down, I have Israel&apos;s back.
Which is why, if during this political season-[laughter]-you hear some questions regarding my administration&apos;s support for Israel, remember that it&apos;s not backed up by the facts. And remember that the U.S.-Israel relationship is simply too
important to be distorted by partisan politics. America&apos;s national security is too important. Israel&apos;s security is too important.
Of course, there are those who question not my security and diplomatic commitments, but rather my administration&apos;s ongoing pursuit of peace between Israelis and Palestinians. So let me say this: I make no apologies for pursuing peace. Israel&apos;s own
leaders understand the necessity of peace. Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Barak, President Peres, each of them have called for two states, a secure Israel that lives side by side with an independent Palestinian state. I believe that peace is
profoundly in Israel&apos;s security interest.
The reality that Israel faces-from shifting demographics to emerging technologies to an extremely difficult international environment-demands a resolution of this issue. And I believe that peace with the Palestinians is consistent with Israel&apos;s
founding values, because of our shared belief in self-determination and because Israel&apos;s place as a Jewish and democratic state must be protected.
Of course, peace is hard to achieve. There&apos;s a reason why it&apos;s remained elusive for six decades. The upheaval and uncertainty in Israel&apos;s neighborhood makes it that much harder, from the horrific violence raging in Syria to the transition in
Egypt. And the division within the Palestinian leadership makes it harder still, most notably, with Hamas&apos;s continued rejection of Israel&apos;s very right to exist.
But as hard as it may be, we should not and cannot give in to cynicism or despair. The changes taking place in the region make peace more important, not less. And I&apos;ve made it clear that there will be no lasting peace unless Israel&apos;s security
concerns are met. That&apos;s why we continue to press Arab leaders to reach out to Israel, and we&apos;ll continue to support the peace treaty with Egypt. That&apos;s why, just as we encourage Israel to be resolute in the pursuit of peace, we have continued to insist
that any Palestinian partner must recognize Israel&apos;s right to exist and reject violence and adhere to existing agreements. And that is why my administration has consistently rejected any efforts to shortcut negotiations or impose an agreement on the
parties.
As Rosy noted, last year, I stood before you and pledged that &quot;the United States will stand up against efforts to single Israel out at the United Nations.&quot; As you know, that pledge has been kept. Last September, I stood before the United Nations
General Assembly and reaffirmed that any lasting peace must acknowledge the fundamental legitimacy of Israel and its security concerns. I said that America&apos;s commitment to Israel&apos;s security is unshakeable, our friendship with Israel is enduring, and
that Israel must be recognized. No American President has made such a clear statement about our support for Israel at the United Nations at such a difficult time. People usually give those speeches before audiences like this one, not before the General
Assembly.
And I must say, there was not a lot of applause. [Laughter] But it was the right thing to do. And as a result, today there is no doubt anywhere in the world that the United States will insist upon Israel&apos;s security and legitimacy. That will be
true as we continue our efforts to pursue-in the pursuit of peace. And that will be true when it comes to the issue that is such a focus for all of us today: Iran&apos;s nuclear program, a threat that has the potential to bring together the worst rhetoric
about Israel&apos;s destruction with the world&apos;s most dangerous weapons.
Let&apos;s begin with a basic truth that you all understand: No Israeli Government can tolerate a nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that denies the Holocaust, threatens to wipe Israel off the map, and sponsors terrorist groups committed to
Israel&apos;s destruction. And so I understand the profound historical obligation that weighs on the shoulders of Bibi Netanyahu and Ehud Barak and all of Israel&apos;s leaders. A nuclear-armed Iran is completely counter to Israel&apos;s security interests. But it is
also counter to the national security interests of the United States.
Indeed, the entire world has an interest in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed Iran would thoroughly undermine the nonproliferation regime that we&apos;ve done so much to build. There are risks that an Iranian nuclear
weapon could fall into the hands of a terrorist organization. It is almost certain that others in the region would feel compelled to get their own nuclear weapon, triggering an arms race in one of the world&apos;s most volatile regions. It would embolden a
regime that has brutalized its own people, and it would embolden Iran&apos;s proxies, who have carried out terrorist attacks from the Levant to southwest Asia.
And that is why, 4 years ago, I made a commitment to the American people and said that we would use all elements of American power to pressure Iran and prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon. And that is what we have done.
When I took office, the efforts to apply pressure on Iran were in tatters. Iran had gone from zero centrifuges spinning to thousands, without facing broad pushback from the world. In the region, Iran was ascendant, increasingly popular and
extending its reach. In other words, the Iranian leadership was united and on the move, and the international community was divided about how to go forward.
And so from my very first months in office, we put forward a very clear choice to the Iranian regime: a path that would allow them to rejoin the community of nations if they meet their international obligations or a path that leads to an
escalating series of consequences if they don&apos;t. In fact, our policy of engagement-quickly rebuffed by the Iranian regime-allowed us to rally the international community as never before, to expose Iran&apos;s intransigence, and to apply pressure that goes
far beyond anything that the United States could do on our own.
Because of our efforts, Iran is under greater pressure than ever before. Some of you will recall, people predicted that Russia and China wouldn&apos;t join us to move towards pressure. They did. And in 2010, the U.N. Security Council overwhelmingly
supported a comprehensive sanctions effort. Few thought that sanctions could have an immediate bite on the Iranian regime. They have, slowing the Iranian nuclear program and virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt in 2011. Many questioned
whether we could hold our coalition together as we moved against Iran&apos;s Central Bank and oil exports. But our friends in Europe and Asia and elsewhere are joining us. And in 2012, the Iranian Government faces the prospect of even more crippling
sanctions.
That is where we are today because of our work. Iran is isolated, its leadership divided and under pressure. And by the way, the Arab Spring has only increased these trends, as the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime is exposed and its ally, the Asad
regime, is crumbling.
Of course, so long as Iran fails to meet its obligations, this problem remains unresolved. The effective implementation of our policy is not enough. We must accomplish our objective. And in that effort, I firmly believe that an opportunity still
remains for diplomacy, backed by pressure, to succeed.
The United States and Israel both assess that Iran does not yet have a nuclear weapon, and we are exceedingly vigilant in monitoring their program. Now the international community has a responsibility to use the time and space that exists.
Sanctions are continuing to increase, and this July, thanks to our diplomatic coordination, a European ban on Iranian oil imports will take hold. Faced with these increasingly dire consequences, Iran&apos;s leaders still have the opportunity to make the
right decision. They can choose a path that brings them back into the community of nations, or they can continue down a dead end.
And given their history, there are, of course, no guarantees that the Iranian regime will make the right choice. But both Israel and the United States have an interest in seeing this challenge resolved diplomatically. After all, the only way to
truly solve this problem is for the Iranian Government to make a decision to forsake nuclear weapons. That&apos;s what history tells us.
Moreover, as President and Commander in Chief, I have a deeply held preference for peace over war. I have sent men and women into harm&apos;s way. I&apos;ve seen the consequences of those decisions in the eyes of those I meet who&apos;ve come back gravely
wounded and the absence of those who don&apos;t make it home. Long after I leave this office, I will remember those moments as the most searing of my Presidency. And for this reason, as part of my solemn obligation to the American people, I will only use
force when the time and circumstances demand it. And I know that Israeli leaders also know all too well the costs and consequences of war, even as they recognize their obligation to defend their country.
So we all prefer to resolve this issue diplomatically. Having said that, Iran&apos;s leaders should have no doubt about the resolve of the United States, just as they should not doubt Israel&apos;s sovereign right to make its own decisions about what is
required to meet its security needs.
I have said that when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I will take no options off the table, and I mean what I say. That includes all elements of American power: a political effort aimed at isolating Iran, a diplomatic
effort to sustain our coalition and ensure that the Iranian program is monitored, an economic effort that imposes crippling sanctions, and yes, a military effort to be prepared for any contingency.
Iran&apos;s leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And as I have made clear time and again during the course of my Presidency, I will not hesitate to use
force when it is necessary to defend the United States and its interests.
Moving forward, I would ask that we all remember the weightiness of these issues, the stakes involved for Israel, for America, and for the world. Already, there is too much loose talk of war. Over the last few weeks, such talk has only benefited
the Iranian Government by driving up the price of oil, which they depend on to fund their nuclear program. For the sake of Israel&apos;s security, America&apos;s security, and the peace and security of the world, now is not the time for bluster. Now&apos;s the time to
let our increased pressure sink in and to sustain the broad international coalition we have built. Now&apos;s the time to heed the timeless advice from Teddy Roosevelt: Speak softly; carry a big stick. And as we do, rest assured that the Iranian Government
will know our resolve and that our coordination will-with Israel will continue.
Now, these are challenging times. But we&apos;ve been through challenging times before, and the United States and Israel have come through them together. Because of our cooperation, citizens in both our countries have benefited from the bonds that
bring us together. I&apos;m proud to be one of those people. In the past, I&apos;ve shared in this forum just why those bonds are so personal for me: the stories of a great-uncle who helped liberate Buchenwald, to my memories of returning there with Elie Wiesel;
from sharing books with President Peres to sharing seders with my young staff in a tradition that started on the campaign trail and continues in the White House; from the countless friends I know in this room to the concept of tikkun olam that has
enriched and guided my life.
As Harry Truman understood, Israel&apos;s story is one of hope. We may not agree on every single issue; no two nations do, and our democracies contain a vibrant diversity of views. But we agree on the big things, the things that matter. And together,
we are working to build a better world, one where our people can live free from fear, one where peace is founded upon justice, one where our children can know a future that is more hopeful than the present.
There is no shortage of speeches on the friendship between the United States and Israel. But I&apos;m also mindful of the proverb, &quot;A man is judged by his deeds, not his words.&quot; So if you want to know where my heart lies, look no further than what I
have done to stand up for Israel, to secure both of our countries, and to see that the rough waters of our time lead to a peaceful and prosperous shore.
Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the people of Israel. God bless the United States of America.

<TI>36,000 Scots take part in global medical study</TI>
<TEXT>NEARLY 36,000 Scots are taking part in a world- leading study that is hoped will lead to new treatments for a wide range of illnesses including cancer, heart disease, diabetes and dementia.
The UK Biobank provides a snapshot of the health and lifestyles of 500,000 people across Britain and became available for research yesterday.
During 10 years participants have provided detailed information about their habits and their health to help set up the one-stop shop for researchers studying a variety of chronic, painful and life-threatening illnesses.
Participants will store various samples with the Biobank, including genetic information, and their conditions will be monitored at regular intervals throughout their lives to chart changes to their health. It will also be used to help tackle
stroke, depression, arthritis, eye problems and muscle disorders.
The resource includes 26,000 people with diabetes, 50,000 with joint disorders, 41,000 teetotallers and 17,000 people who have had a heart attack.
The UK Biobank chief scientist, Dr Cathie Sudlow, is clinical reader at the University of Edinburgh and honorary consultant neurologist at the Western General Hospital in the Scottish capital.
She said: This is without doubt a very exciting day for medical research, not just in the UK but around the world.
She added: As a doctor caring for patients who have had strokes and involved in stroke research, I am particularly excited about the potential of UK Biobank to help us to understand better than ever before the complex underlying causes of
different types of strokes.
The £100 million project has been part-funded by the Scottish Government.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: It is a world-leading scientific resource, in terms of size and data quality. Nearly 40,000 Scots have provided data and samples.</TEXT>

<TI>In Health Case, Appeals to a Justices Idea of Liberty</TI>
<TEXT>WASHINGTON  The way to frame a &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot;&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;
argument meant to persuade Justice &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/anthony_m_kennedy/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot;&gt;Anthony M. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;
is to talk about liberty. It is his touchstone and guiding principle, and his conception of liberty is likely to determine the future of President Obamas &lt;a
href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot;&gt;health care law&lt;/a&gt;
.
If the administration is to prevail in the case, it must capture at least one vote beyond those of the courts four more liberal justices, who are thought virtually certain to vote to uphold the law. The administrations best hope is Justice
Kennedy.
The point was not lost on Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who
at the court this week with remarks aimed squarely at Justice Kennedy. Mr. Verrilli said there was a profound connection between health care and liberty.
There will be millions of people with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, he said, and as a result of the health care that they will get, they will be unshackled from the disabilities that those diseases put on them and have the
opportunity to enjoy the blessings of liberty.
Paul D. Clement, representing 26 states challenging the law, had a comeback. I would respectfully suggest, he said, that its a very funny conception of liberty that forces somebody to purchase an insurance policy whether they want it or not.
Justice Kennedys understanding of liberty is idiosyncratic, and there is every reason to think that both lawyers arguments in the concluding minutes of the argument on Wednesday afternoon resonated with him, said Helen J. Knowles, the author of
. (The title is telling. Another book on the justice, by Frank J. Colucci, is called
.)
I really dont think Justice Kennedy has any idea at the moment how hes going to vote in these cases, Professor Knowles said.
Indeed, the evidence from
, on the constitutionality of the health care laws requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty, was mixed.
Justices tend to ask more questions of the lawyers whose positions they oppose, and Justice Kennedy posed six questions to Mr. Verrilli and just three to the two lawyers challenging the law.
The questions to Mr. Verrilli were, moreover, mostly easy to read. They were crisp expressions of discomfort with the administrations arguments.
Can you create commerce in order to regulate it? Justice Kennedy asked.
This is a step beyond what our cases have allowed, the affirmative duty to act to go into commerce he said. If that is so, do you not have a heavy burden of justification?
Can you identify for us some limits on the commerce clause? he asked.
Those questions fit neatly within one strain of Justice Kennedys understanding of liberty, one he discussed at length last year in
.
Limiting federal power, he wrote, protects the liberty of all persons within a state by ensuring that laws enacted in excess of delegated governmental power cannot direct or control their actions. By denying any one government complete
jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power. When government acts in excess of its lawful powers, that liberty is at stake.
The case concerned a federal prosecution of a domestic dispute. Mr. Clement was the lawyer on the winning side.
But there is another strain to Justice Kennedys conception of liberty, one that may help Mr. Verrilli. When you think about liberty relative to Kennedy, Professor Knowles said, the element most important to him will be the idea of individual
responsibility. He thinks the government has the power to ensure that the responsible exercise of liberty be done in an educated manner.
That impulse seemed to inform the most closely scrutinized exchange on Tuesday.
The young person who is uninsured, Justice Kennedy told Michael A. Carvin, a lawyer for private parties challenging the law, is uniquely proximately very close to affecting the rates of insurance and the costs of providing medical care in a way
that is not true in other industries. Thats my concern in the case.
Mr. Carvin responded that the law actually frustrated individual responsibility. Theyre compelling us to enter into the marketplace, he said, but theyre prohibiting us from buying the only economically sensible product that we would want,
catastrophic insurance.
That answer may or may not have satisfied Justice Kennedy, but it was alert to his thinking. As Ilya Shapiro wrote in
in 2010, Justice Kennedys jurisprudence is a constant struggle to find the right balance between liberty and responsibility.
Justice Kennedys critics say his pronouncements on liberty are empty of real content.
In 1992, joining with Justices Sandra Day OConnor and David H. Souter to uphold the core of the constitutional right to abortion identified in
, Justice Kennedy
that at the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Justice Antonin Scalia later
as the famed sweet-mystery-of-life passage.
Justice Kennedy has participated in three decisions on the scope of federal power under the Constitutions commerce clause. He twice voted to strike down the law before him. Most recently, he voted to uphold a law allowing federal regulation of
home-grown medicinal
.
He wrote an opinion in one of the cases,
explaining why a law concerning guns near schools had to go. The decision rested, he wrote, on the theory that two governments accord more liberty than one, which he said gave rise to a grave constitutional obligation if democratic liberty and the
federalism that secures it are to endure.
Writing in
in 2010, Eric A. Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said Justice Kennedys writing could be vapid and disappointing for its lack of rigor. Liberty, in his mind, explains the right to abortion, but does not stand in the way of
certain limits on abortion, Professor Posner wrote. In what sense, then, does this commitment to liberty have explanatory power?
Justice Kennedy may be hard to read, but it does not stop people from trying. The Supreme Court chamber grows a little quieter when he asks a question, and other justices seem to grow more attentive. And the lawyers who argued before him this week
indicated intimate familiarity with his writings and a fine-tuned sensitivity to trying to satisfy him.
On hearing that Justice Kennedy had concerns about how young people without insurance affect others rates, Mr. Carvin paused before he answered.
I may be misunderstanding you, Justice Kennedy, Mr. Carvin said. I hope Im not.</TEXT>

<TI>Snow saves diabetic, 76, in desert</TI>
<TEXT>A 76-YEAR-OLD diabetic man has survived 10 days in the remote Nevada desert by melting snow and using skills he learned as a scout, but a friend who was with him and ventured away to get help died.
James Klemovich and Laszlo Szabo, 75, went to investigate some mines in the state when their car became stuck on a lonely road with no mobile phone service, Klemovich&apos;s wife, Joanne, said.
The men tried unsuccessfully to dislodge the car, and lit flares and started fires hoping somebody would see them in north-western Nevada&apos;s Pershing County, an area where less than 7000 people are spread over 15,000sqkm.
They used a towel to strain ditch water and snow into water bottles, but, after four or five days, Mr Szabo left to get help.
Mrs Klemovich began to worry when several days passed without a phone call from her husband.
I figured maybe they&apos;d had an accident and they were stranded, she said. I thought maybe they were in a mine shaft.
She said she was expecting the worst when authorities called on Tuesday night to say her husband had been found by military personnel who were training in the area.
I thought it was bad news, but it was very good news, she said by telephone from the couple&apos;s home in Littleton, Colorado.
I didn&apos;t know what to even do or say.
Mr Klemovich has diabetes, wears a pacemaker and has had triple bypass heart surgery.
He told her he did not panic while he sat for days waiting for Mr Szabo&apos;s return.
He kept a journal, noting how much water he drank and what he did each day.
And he wrote a letter each day for her.
Mr Szabo was found dead about 2.5km away. Mr Klemovich is still in Nevada, waiting for the car to be recovered before returning home.</TEXT>

<TI>Polypectomy cut colorectal cancer deaths 53%.(NEWS)</TI>
<TEXT>FROM THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
Colonoscopic polypectomy reduced the risk of death from colorectal cancer by more than half in a study that followed patients for as long as 23 years, investigators reported in the Feb. 23 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
The findings demonstrate that adenomas identified and removed at colonoscopy are clinically important because they have the potential to progress to cancer and cause death, said Ann G. Zauber, Ph.D., of the department of epidemiology and
biostatistics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, and her associates.
The investigators performed long-term follow-up of subjects who had participated in the National Polyp Study, a randomized clinical trial of patients prospectively referred to seven clinical centers for colonoscopy during 19801990.
The researchers analyzed mortality data from 2,602 of these subjects who had been found to have adenomatous polyps at that initial colonoscopy so they could determine whether removing the lesions had actually saved lives.
The study subjects had been referred for colonoscopy because of positive findings on a barium enema examination (27%), sigrnoidoscopy (15%), fecal occult blood testing (11%), or other tests (10%), or because they had symptoms (3Z%) or a family
history of colorectal cancer (5%). The median follow-up was approximately 16 years, with a maximum follow-up of 23 years.
A search of the National Death Index, a registry of all deaths in the United States, was used to identify the 1,246 study subjects (48%) who had died during follow-up, including 12 who died from colorectal cancer.
The authors then determined the expected number of deaths from colorectal cancer in the general population among people of comparable age, sex, and race, and found that 25.4 such deaths would be expected. This figure was determined by using data
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, and sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.
This indicated that colonoscopy with polyp removal reduced mortality from colorectal cancer by 53%, compared with the expected rate of this cancer in the general population.
&quot;The cumulative mortality rate in the adenoma cohort at 20 years was 0.8%, as compared with an estimated 1.5% in the general population, on the basis of SEER data,&quot; Dr. Zauber and her colleagues wrote (N. Engl. J. Med. 2012;366:687-96).
The investigators also compared colorectal cancer mortality in the study cohort against that in a group of 773 National Polyp Study participants who had been found to have nonadenomatous polyps on their initial colonoscopy. During the first 10
years after that colonoscopy, mortality in the adenoma cohort (0.19%) was not significantly different from mortality in this internal control group (0.15%).
Thus, the risk of death from colorectal cancer was comparable between patients whose adenomas were removed at initial colonoscopy and those who only had nonadenomatous polyps, which were also removed, they said.
Finally, Dr. Zauber and her associates used a microsimulation model to estimate what the mortality would have been if the adenomas had not been removed &quot;and the natural history of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence had proceeded without intervention.&quot;
This model &quot;showed an even larger reduction in mortality [after] polypectomy than the comparison with the SEER incidence-based mortality rates,&quot; they noted.
At present, there are three prospective, long-term, randomized controlled trials taking place in northern Europe, Spain, and the United States in which mortality end points after screening colonoscopy will be measured directly.
Those data, however, will not be available for at least another decade.
In the meantime, the findings of this study indicate that identifying and removing adenomas via colonoscopy significantly cuts the rate of death from colorectal cancer, the investigators concluded.
VITALS
Major Finding: After a median follow-up of 16 years, colorectal cancer mortality was 53% lower in patients who had undergone colonoscopy with removal of adenomatous polyps (12 deaths) than would be expected in the general population (24.5
deaths).
Data Source: An analysis of mortality data on 2,602 patients with adenomatous polyps that were identified and removed via colonoscopy in 1980-1990, 773 patients with nonadenomatous polyps, and members of the general population.
Disclosures: This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute, the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the TaveI-Reznik Fund, and the Cantor Colon Cancer Fund. No financial conflicts of interest were reported.
Related Article: Real-world adherence is never 100%.
The findings by Dr. Zauber and her associates indicate that colonoscopy with polypectomy is an effective screening test, as long as compliance is adequate, wrote Dr. Michael Bretthauer and Dr. Mette Kalager.
Under the controlled conditions of this study, 100% of the patients underwent colonoscopy. Such a 100% compliance rate would never occur in a real-world colonoscopy screening scenario. &quot;Randomized, population-based trials are needed to obtain
valid estimates of the effectiveness of screening on a population level,&quot; Dr. Bretthauer and Dr. Kalager said.

<TI>More children are getting kidney stones.(KIDNEY DISEASE)</TI>
<TEXT>STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, COLO. -- Kidney stones, long considered an adult malady, have become vastly more common among children in the past decade, in concert with the obesity epidemic.
The clinical presentation of urolithia sis in children is often different from that in adults, so physicians are frequently caught off guard.
&quot;The diagnosis of kidney stones is often not the first thing on the differential diagnosis list--or even on the list--for a child with abdominal pain,&quot; Dr. Beth A. Vogt observed at the meeting.
The younger the child with a kidney stone, the more likely the clinical presentation will be nonspecific abdominal pain rather than the flank pain or renal colic typical in affected adults, said Dr. Vogt, a pediatric nephrologist at Case Western
Reserve University, Cleveland.
Thus, in the child with nonspecific abdominal pain, it&apos;s important to add urolithiasis to the differential diagnosis list, which has included viral gastroenteritis, appendicitis, cholecystitis, intussusception, and food poisoning, she said.
Gross hematuria is present in 30%-40% of children who present with kidney stones. Dysuria is also common. In addition, asymptomatic kidney stones are frequently detected incidentally in children undergoing ultrasound or CT following traumatic
injury.
The primary care physician&apos;s role in pediatric urolithiasis is to make the diagnosis, begin acute management with hydration and pain control, hospitalize if necessary, and refer the patient to urology for intervention if the stone is so large it&apos;s
unlikely to pass.
Referral to a nephrologist is recommended after a first-ever stone has passed and the child has resumed normal activities. The nephrologist must figure out why the child is forming stones and come up with a specific prevention plan (for example, a
low-sodium diet in patients with hypercalciuria, or antibiotics in children with infection-related struvite stones), Dr. Vogt said.
&quot;In adults, the standard practice is to wait until they prove to be recurrent stone formers before doing a work-up. That&apos;s not the case in children. Don&apos;t wait until after a child has had several stones to refer to nephrology. We find something
metabolically wrong in about 75% of the kids,&quot; she said.
The diagnosis of pediatric urolithiasis is suggested by the combination of abdominal or flank pain, hematuria on a urine dipstick test, and crystals in the urine upon microscopic examination. A couple of caveats, though: Studies indicate that up
to 15% of children with active stone disease have a negative urinalysis, so urolithiasis can&apos;t be ruled out on the basis of a negative urine dipstick. Also, many children who don&apos;t have kidney stone disease have crystals in their urine.
The best initial diagnostic imaging study is kidney ultrasound. It doesn&apos;t involve radiation, which is an important advantage because some young patients will continue making stones and will therefore need to undergo imaging many times.
Ultrasound is very good at identifying stones in the renal parenchyma, but not ureteral stones or very small stones. So if the clinical picture and laboratory re suits suggest urolithiasis but the ultrasound is negative, it&apos;s time to move on to CT
without contrast, by far the most sensitive test. It is ordered by requesting a &quot;CT stone protocol.&quot;
Acute management of stone disease entails oral or intravenous hydration to push the stone through the urinary tract. Pain medication is important. Tamsulosin (Flomax) is prescribed off label to induce ureteral relaxation and assist in the stone&apos;s
passage. It&apos;s useful to have the patient use a urine-straining device to try to catch the stone for later analysis.
Urologists consistently recommend a 4to 6-week trial of spontaneous passage, provided the child doesn&apos;t have a urinary tract infection, is able to hydrate orally, and obtains pain control with oral medications. &quot;When you tell that to parents, they
say, Are you kidding?&apos; That&apos;s a long, long time. Parents don&apos;t like it,&quot; Dr. Vogt said.
A stone larger than 10 mm is so unlikely to pass spontaneously that Dr. Vogt recommends going straight to urologic intervention. A stone less than 5 mm will usually pass spontaneously, even in a child.
Urologists will typically place a ureter-long stent in a patient with refractory nausea and vomiting or an infection. This allows urine to bypass an obstructive stone. &quot;&apos;It buys you time. It gets the patient out of the cycle of pain, vomiting, and
renal colic,&quot; she explained.
A week or two later, the urologist will take out the stent and remove the stone, most often by ureteroscopy. This involves inserting the ureteroscope through the bladder and capturing the stone in a basket, sometimes after breaking it into
fragments via laser lithotripsy.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is still widely performed in adults. It is less popular in children because of the theoretical risk of damaging nearby healthy tissues, which might then result in hypertension or diabetes.
Although most cases of pediatric urolithiasis are managed on an outpatient basis, today roughly 1 in 1,000 pediatric hospitalizations is for kidney stones. The explanation for the increase over the past decade isn&apos;t entirely clear. Increased
consumption of salty, high-protein, processed foods and decreased water intake have been implicated.
Prevention measures include ample fluid intake--more than 2 L daily in teens--and liberal consumption of fruits and vegetables to increase excretion of stone-inhibiting citrate into the urine. Restriction of dietary calcium is not recommended,
even in calcium stone formers.
&quot;I usually tell patients to drink enough fluids that their urine looks very dilute. You don&apos;t want dark yellow urine,&quot; said Dr. Vogt, who indicated that she had no conflicts of interest to report.

<TI>FED:Abbott needs &apos;personal politics lesson&apos;</TI>
<TEXT>GREER By Colin Brinsden
CANBERRA, March 30 AAP - Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has again shown he needs a lesson in &quot;personal politics 101&quot; after making inappropriate remarks for a second time in a week, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon says.
Mr Abbott said on Friday he regretted a remark he made in reference to Prime Minister Julia Gillard&apos;s wardrobe and appearance.
Feminist Germaine Greer started the furore after she told an ABC TV panel that Ms Gillard wore unflattering jackets and had a &quot;big arse&quot;.
A woman speaking to Mr Abbott at a community forum in Victoria on Thursday raised the subject again saying: &quot;Get some of those jackets off her&quot; and he replied: &quot;I know, I know, I know. Germaine Greer was right on that subject.&quot;
Mr Abbott said he regretted the remark when quizzed on the Nine Network on Friday.
&quot;It was an off-the-cuff remark responding to an observation of a member of the public and I shouldn&apos;t have said it and I regret it,&quot; he said.
The latest verbal gaffe came just a week after Mr Abbott apologised in parliament for inappropriately saying Ms Gillard and the leader of the House of Representatives, Anthony Albanese, were &quot;walking around with targets on their foreheads&quot;.
Ms Roxon reminded reporters on Friday that Mr Abbott had abused Bernie Banton when he was dying from asbestos-induced fibrosis, and had &quot;happily&quot; swore at her (Ms Roxon) after a debate at the National Press Club.
&quot;This is Mr Abbott losing control and perhaps being under more pressure than he has been under in a while,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I also think this is Mr Abbott who needs a lesson on personal politics 101 which is, if your wife or girlfriend says, `Does my bum look big in this?&apos; you say, `No&apos; and get on with it.&quot;
She didn&apos;t think it was appropriate for anyone to comment on the prime minister&apos;s clothing, including Ms Greer.
&quot;Germaine Greer really didn&apos;t do herself proud in making those comments,&quot; she said.
Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten agreed, saying it was a case of an iconic feminist having a crack at another successful woman.
&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have said what Tony Abbott said, it was just ridiculous,&quot; Mr Shorten told the Seven Network.
Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey told the same program it was a &quot;no-go area&quot; for any male to talk about female clothing.
But he told Fairfax radio that the way one dresses and presents themselves does matter because it forms part of the judgment made of an individual.
&quot;For example, I can say to you, with absolute confidence, that you&apos;re unlikely to see me in Speedos,&quot; he said.
But he said both Ms Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan had said some &quot;nasty things&quot; about him in the past.
&quot;For me it&apos;s water off a duck&apos;s back. It&apos;s no revelation that I&apos;m a fully sized guy,&quot; he said.
&quot;Frankly when you pass comment about someone&apos;s weight or something like that I think it says more about you than it does about them.&quot;

<TI>Jones is UC Teacher of the Year</TI>
<TEXT>By BAILEY DARROW HERALD-CITIZEN Staff BAXTER -- First Upperman High School teacher of the Year, then Putnam County high school Teacher of the Year, and now Tracy Jones has been named Upper Cumberland Teacher of the Year. Jones was selected as one
of 27 top teachers in the state. &quot;It really just blows my mind,&quot; Jones said. &quot;I never expected to win that part.&quot; Jones has been teaching at UHS for about three years now but has been teaching in Putnam County schools for 19 years, 13 of those being at
Cookeville High School. At Upperman, she&apos;s a math teacher, currently teaching upper-level and honors math classes, and she says she strives to make it as fun as it can possibly be. Jones was named Teacher of the Year eight years ago but took another
step up by winning a regional award this time.
Upon winning the district award, Jones wrote additional essays, describing her philosophy on education, her contributions to education, what she believes to be an outstanding teacher, and why she became a teacher. Judges based their selection of
Jones on those essays. &quot;I believe that being an educator is about so much more than just imparting knowledge,&quot; Jones wrote in her application essay. &quot;It is about being a mentor, listener, and guide to all of my students both past and present. &quot;In my
classroom I do not just teach mathematics. I try to teach my students to work hard, take pride in their work, be honest, and treat everyone in the class with respect. These are concepts that are important not only for success in school, but in life as
well.&quot; If Jones is selected as one of nine finalists, she will be in competition for the state-wide Teacher of the Year Award.</TEXT>

<TI>Foundation takes bold approach to psoriasis: new National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines focus on managing the disease beyond the topical level.(NEWS)</TI>
<TEXT>The new National Psoriasis Foundation consensus guidelines on the management of plaque psoriasis take a practical approach to helping physicians manage the disease beyond topical treatment.
The guidelines feature a table summarizing the latest consensus on eight systemic medications, and they hone in on specific forms of psoriasis in a way that is more quickly understandable than in the past, according to lead author Dr. Sylvia Hsu,
chief of Ben Taub Dermatology Service and a dermatology professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
&quot;The aim is to simplify and clarify when to use these drugs for patients whose psoriasis is beyond topical treatment,&quot; she said. &apos;A lot of the drugs can be used first line, so it&apos;s not like a treatment algorithm.&quot;
Dr. Hsu acknowledged that the guidelines are a bit bold because they directly state, for example, that acitretin doesn&apos;t work well for plaque psoriasis, and that evidence is scant to support the use of alefacept to achieve full clearance. The
latter position was devised well before Astellas announced in December 2011 that it was pulling alefacept from the market, she said in an interview.
Physicians may also be surprised that the guidelines, published in Archives of Dermatology (2012; 148:95-102), recommend cyclosporine as a short-term solution for up to 12 weeks to control a psoriasis flare.
&quot;We know that you can use cydosporine for up to a year because it&apos;s FDA-approved for up to 12 months, but the typical use is as a quick-fix to transition to other agents that are slower acting,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s a practical table.&quot;
Established drugs such as etanercept (Enbrel) and adalimumab (Humira) are recommended as first-line therapies for plaque psoriasis, but so is the newer monoclonal antibody ustekinumab (Stelara), so avoid the misconception that dermatologists need
to prescribe systemic medications in a particular order based upon time on the market, Dr. Hsu noted.
The National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) guidelines, however, do not provide a formula for how to treat patients, said coauthor Dr. Steven R. Feldman, professor of dermatology at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C.
&quot;They don&apos;t say if you have this patient, this must be done first and then if that doesn&apos;t work, do this second, and that third,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no guideline of that type for psoriasis because no one treatment is better than all the other
treatments in every way and patients weigh the various variables differently.&quot;
The new guidelines were adapted from the Canadian Guidelines for the Management of Plaque Psoriasis to reflect practice patterns in the United States, and are very similar to those published on the subject by the American Academy of Dermatology
(AAD), Dr. Feldman said.
&quot;I think these guidelines are clearly consensus guidelines, getting the experts together and deciding what they feel is best, whereas the AAD made a special effort to create evidence-based guidelines based on the available data,&quot; he said. &quot;In the
end, I think the recommendations are basically the same thing. Neither one tells physicians exactly what to do in a given situation; it&apos;s more about describing the reasonable options that a patient and physician could choose in any situation.&quot;
NPF and AAD guidelines coauthor Dr. Mark Lebwohl, professor and chair of the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said the AAD guidelines are superb, but that &quot;having this second set of guidelines allows us to
answer even more questions.&quot;
Dr. Lebwohl noted that there is often information in one guideline that is missing from another because new psoriasis developments happen so quickly. For example, a section recommending that physicians consider withholding tumor necrosis factor
antagonists in psoriasis patients undergoing elective surgery was borrowed from the Canadian guidelines, but does not appear in the AAD guidelines, he said. The section discusses the controversy over the potential for increased risk of postsurgical
infection in patients on biologics, and provides guidance on when specific agents should be withheld.
Conversely, the NPF guidelines discuss the pros and cons of the excimer laser, but this discussion is missing from the Canadian guidelines because the laser is not approved there.
&quot;In a year, the guidelines will all be out of date again; they are a work in progress,&quot; said Dr. Lebwohl, who added that the NPF is trying to fend a mechanism to update the guidelines in real time as new developments arise.
What the NPF/Canadian guidelines offer physicians is a rigorous evaluation of the literature with a patient-focused approach to psoriasis treatment, said Dr. Kim A. Papp, director of research at Probity Medical Research, Waterloo, Ont., who helped
coauthor both sets of guidelines.
&quot;We all appreciate that the art of medicine incorporates habit, consensus, experience, and hopefully sound data,&quot; he said.
&quot;Consequently, a second and perhaps equally important offering of the guidelines to physicians is an independent affirmation or an independent negation of one&apos;s art in treating psoriasis.&quot;
Where the NPF guidelines may prove particularly helpful is in supporting that therapeutic choice with insurers. If a physician thought that a particular biologic agent was the best treatment option for a patient, that physician could point to the
guidelines as a way to let insurers know that what is being recommended is within the standard of care, said Dr. Feldman.
The new guidelines could also push physicians to be more aggressive in using some of the available systemic agents.
He pointed out that one of the &quot;&apos;major enthusiasms&quot; for creating the guidelines was a 2009 National Psoriasis Foundation survey finding that 57% of patients with severe psoriasis were re ceiving treatment insufficient to achieve adequate control
(J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2007;57:957-62).
&quot;&apos;There needed to be guidelines that would encourage physicians to provide patients treatment that met the severity of their illness,&quot; said Dr. Feldman, who suggested that safety concerns, dated training, and a perception that psoriasis isn&apos;t such
a bad disease, all played into the lack of aggressive treatment.
The NPF guidelines clearly detail the safety risks associated with each agent, and have a specific section on special populations, including pregnant women, patients with HIV, and those with hepatitis B or C.
For the purpose of the new guidelines, patients are considered to have moderate to severe psoriasis if they cannot achieve or would not be expected to achieve adequate control using topical agents, with adequacy defined by the patient&apos;s own
perception of the disease and its burdens. Cutoffs based on clinical metrics, such as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, percentage of body surface area affected, and the Dermatological Life Quality Index are necessary in clinical trials, but &quot;have
little value in daily practice,&quot; the authors noted.
Strict numeric cutoffs can also cause problems with insurers and reimbursement.
&quot;This [document] provides the insurers and other regulators the opportunity to set more meaningful standards for their policies,&quot; Dr. Feldman said. &quot;When they see guidelines published in the Archives and supported by the National Psoriasis
Foundation, it lends a lot of weight to doing things the way doctors do things in the patient&apos;s best interest.&quot;
The physicians interviewed for this story all disclosed consultancies and research arrangements with multiple companies that manufacture psoriasis treatments.</TEXT>

<TI>Longer life in Europe needs early disease prevention and diagnosis in th65s</TI>
<TEXT>Healthy practices begun early in life can help to forestall the onset of disease, according to a new study by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Medical experts are suggesting that the focus on healthy ageing should begin at birth and continue
throughout adult years-well before one reaches old age.
The report, &quot;Never too early: Tackling chronic disease to extend healthy life years&quot;, sponsored by Abbott, a global healthcare company, identifies measures that can be taken to prevent and manage chronic disease. Launched at Economist Conferences&apos;
Healthcare in Europe summit last week, the research aims to contribute to the debate surrounding the European Commission&apos;s Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing by looking at how to ensure individuals reach old age in good health.
The research assesses the effects of poor coordination among healthcare providers, governments, and private employers on making the necessary changes to the healthcare system to improve the healthy longevity of both individuals and the system. It
identifies promising initiatives in prevention, early intervention and management of chronic disease which can contribute to healthy ageing. The report also explores how the focus on reactive, hospital-based care of the sick can be shifted towards a
proactive, preventive and patient-centred approach to improving health.
Average life spans across Europe will rise from 75 years currently to 82 by 2050, according to forecasts by the UN Population Division. Yet the promise of healthy ageing in Europe is clouded by the rising incidence of chronic disease. This is
threatening not only the quality of life of older Europeans, but also the ability of Europe&apos;s healthcare systems to cope with their increasing demands. Without adequate reform of the care system, ageing will become an unsustainable burden for Europe.
The key findings of the research also found:
¥ The scourge of chronic diseases is largely preventable. Between 70%-80% of European healthcare costs are spent on chronic care. Chronic diseases account for over 86% of deaths in the EU. Scientists believe that much of the disease burden can be
prevented, or at least substantially delayed, through a combination of primary prevention measures, screening and early intervention.
¥ Prevention includes early diagnosis and intervention. The &quot;four basics&quot; of primary prevention are well known: a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding tobacco, and eschewing excessive alcohol intake. However, secondary prevention-early
screening and diagnosis-and tertiary prevention-early intervention to slow the progress of diseases identified-also play important roles in reducing the burden of chronic disease.
¥ It is never too early to tackle chronic diseases such as cardio-vascular and respiratory illnesses, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, dementia, kidney and liver diseases, obesity and overweight. Indeed, healthy practices begun in infancy-and perhaps even
earlier, in vitro-can help to forestall the onset of disease.
¥ Care of chronic conditions has distinct needs compared to acute care. To ensure appropriate care for chronic disease sufferers as well as free up medical resources for acute-care patients, communities and healthcare systems should direct more
resources to wellness, prevention, and disease management for chronic patients.
¥ Healthcare should be integrated and patient-centred. Medical and other services such as mental health, in-home sanitary care, and instruction in self-monitoring and self-care methods must be integrated to create an effective patient-centred
chronic care system. This is particularly important for patients suffering from more than one chronic disease.
¥ Healthcare should be devolved as far as possible down the provider chain. As part of patient-centred healthcare, patients should be encouraged to do as much as possible for themselves, with appropriate support from a variety of providers.
Pharmacists, nurses, community workers, home care workers and others can all play a part, and often are in a better position than doctors and hospitals to provide time-intensive coaching and personal attention to patients.</TEXT>

<TI>Prevention of cardiovascular disease in women.(CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR FAMILY PHYSICIANS)</TI>
<TEXT>The American Heart Association released updated guidelines in 2011 for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women. The new guidelines emphasize risk assessment, a combination of lifestyle and pharmacologic management for the prevention of
cardiovascular disease, and an emphasis on following through with evidence-based effective interventions.
The lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) approaches 1 in 2 in all women; therefore, prevention is the most important aspect of care. Women should be risk stratified into the following three categories:
* High risk. Women at high risk have known CVD, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage kidney disease. The high-risk classification now includes women with a Framingham 10-year predicted CVD risk of at least 10%.
This important change from a score of at least 20% takes into account vascular events that include stroke, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease and is not limited to coronary heart disease (CHD).
Stroke accounts for a higher portion of total CVD events than does CHD in women--the opposite of the male CVD disease profile. Each year, 55,000 more women than men die of stroke before they reach the age of 75 years.
* At risk. At-risk women are those with at least one major CVD risk factor, such as tobacco dependence, metabolic syndrome, or poor exercise tolerance.
* Ideal cardiovascular health. The third category includes women who possess a newly defined concept of &quot;&apos;ideal cardiovascular health.&quot;
To be considered at ideal cardiovascular health, all of the following eight requirements must be achieved without medical intervention: absence of clinical CVD, total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dL, blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg, fasting
blood glucose less than 100 mg/dL, body mass index less than 25 kg/[m.sup.2], abstinence from tobacco, recommended level of physical activity, and healthy eating habits similar to those recommended by DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension).
The achievement of ideal cardiovascular health by patients is strongly associated with greater quality of life and significantly decreased risks for CVD events.
It should be noted that a history of preeclampsia approximately doubles the risk for subsequent ischemic heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolic events, even 5-15 years post partum.
From Evidence-Based to Effectiveness-Based
Beyond evidence that documents efficacy in research, the 2011 update emphasizes strategies that demonstrate sufficient evidence of clinical benefit for CVD outcomes.
This transformation from evidence-based to effectiveness-based guidelines acknowledges real-world challenges and considerations for both providers and patients, such as cost effectiveness and barriers to adherence.
The guidelines continue to prioritize lifestyle approaches to CVD prevention. The AHA has developed the &quot;Get With the Guidelines--Outpatient&quot; program to improve the implementation of CVD prevention guidelines (
advantage. org / TGA).
Diversity and Disparities
Unjustified differences in cardiovascular health among various populations remain a serious public health issue.
There is evidence that black and Latina women fare much worse in comparison with white women in the United States. The highest coronary heart death rates and the highest overall CVD morbidity and mortality occur in black women.
Health care providers must consider multiple facets of diversity, including race/ethnic origin, age, socioeconomic status, culture, language, and literacy in order to eliminate disparities in health care delivery.
Bottom Line
When possible, the patient-physician partnership should aim for the &quot;ideal cardiovascular health&quot; risk category.
The AHA committee focuses on practical and cost-effective approaches including lifestyle modification and the use of affordable medications such as aspirin and generic statins, when indicated, in order to promote adherence to the guidelines, and
to improve cardiovascular preventive care for all women.
In addition, understanding and implementing effective education requires a team-based, patient-centered approach that includes the family and key health care personnel. Health care providers must consider a woman&apos;s longitudinal, long-term risk for
CVD, and adapt the AHA guidelines to the various stages along her life&apos;s continuum.

A Summary of CVD Prevention Guidelines
Lifestyle Interventions
* Smoking cessation. Women who smoke should be clearly advised and helped to stop smoking.
* Physical activity. At least 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise or 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise are recommended, with greater amounts of exercise giving further benefit. Muscle-strengthening exercise should be done at least 2
days a week.
* Diet. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables, as well as whole-grain, high-fiber foods, is recommended along with fish at least twice a week. Intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, alcohol, sodium, and sugar should be limited; and trans-fatty acids
should be avoided.
* Weight control. Try to achieve a BMI less than 25 kg/[m.sup.2] though diet and exercise.
* Omega-3 fatty acids. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of fish or in capsule form (for example, EPA 1,800 mg/day) may be considered in women with hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia for primary and secondary
prevention.
Major Risk Factor Interventions
* Blood pressure. The optimal level is less than 120/80 mm Hg. When BP is greater than 140/90 mm Hg, then pharmacotherapy is indicated.
* Lipids. Follow the recommendations in the ATP III guidelines. In addition, in women older than 60 years who have estimated coronary heart disease risk greater than 10%, statins may be considered if the hsCRP level is greater than 2 mg/dL.
Drug Interventions
* Preventive drug intervention: Aspirin. Aspirin (75-325 mg daily) is indicated in high-risk women with CHD or diabetes mellitus. Aspirin therapy can be useful in women older than 65 years (81 mg daily or 100 mg every other day) if blood pressure
is controlled, and if the benefit for ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction prevention is likely to outweigh the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. Aspirin therapy may be reasonable for women younger than 65 years for ischemic
stroke prevention.
* Potentially harmful drug interventions include postmenopausal hormone therapy, antioxidant supplements, folic acid, and aspirin for MI prevention in healthy women younger than 65 years.

<TI>Fewer NSAIDs, more falls in arthritis?(NEWS)</TI>
<TEXT>EXPERT ANALYSIS FROM A SYMPOSIUM SPONSORED BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY
SNOWMASS, COLO. -- The guideline-endorsed demotion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in favor of narcotic analgesics for chronic pain has led to a marked increase in falls, fractures, and other bad outcomes among elderly arthritis patients.
&quot;I think the real take-home message here is that current guidelines for the treatment of pain should be revisited,&quot; Dr. Bruce N. Cronstein asserted at the conference.
Since the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)-selective NSAID rofecoxib (Vioxx) was famously taken off the market in late 2004 because of a scandal related to the cover-up of an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), prescriptions for narcotic
analgesics in elderly patients with arthritis have risen sharply. This trend accelerated following the 2007 publication of an American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement on the treatment of chronic pain in patients with or at increased risk
for heart disease (Circulation 2007;115:1634-42). The AHA guidelines elevated short-term use of narcotic analgesics to first-tier status alongside aspirin, acetaminophen, and tramadol, while demoting both COX-2-selective and nonselective NSAIDs to
second-tier status.
The AHA recommendations have been embraced by geriatrics groups and other medical societies. Notably, however, the American College of Rheumatology has declined to get on board, observed Dr. Cronstein, Dr. Paul R. Esserman professor of medicine at
New York University.
Data supporting the unintended consequences of such changes in treatment priorities come from a study by Dr. Cronstein and his associates. They conducted a nested case-control study of 3,830 elderly patients with osteoarthritis (OA) in the
Geisinger Health Plan in Danville, Pa., who had fractures and 11,490 others matched for age and Charlson Comorbidity Index without fractures. In a multivariate analysis, patients on narcotic analgesics had a threefold greater risk of falls or fractures
than those on either COX-2-selective or nonselective NSAIDs.
Dr. Cronstein observed that large studies indicate that the frequency of positive tests for prescription narcotic analgesics in employees involved in workplace accidents has increased significantly since 2005. Meanwhile, prescription narcotic
analgesic abuse among younger individuals has ballooned. But while it&apos;s interesting to speculate that these trends might be related to Vioxx going off the market and the general disenchantment with all NSAIDs that followed, there is no concrete evidence
of such an association, he conceded.
Other data supporting the unappreciated risk of opiates in this population comes from an unpublished study con ducted by Dr. Cronstein and his associates that documented the changing pattern of analgesic prescriptions for elderly patients with OA
since 2005.
During 2001-2004, 24% of elderly patients with OA in the Geisinger system were on a narcotic only for pain relief, 15% were on a narcotic analgesic plus a COX2-selective NSAID, and 13% were on COX-2-selective NSAID monotherapy. But in 2005-2009,
56% of patients were on monotherapy with a narcotic analgesic, 9% were on a narcotic plus a COX-2-selective NSAID, and 2% were on COX-2-selective NSAID monotherapy.
Thus, the use of narcotic analgesics as the sole prescription medication for pain relief in elderly OA patients more than doubled after Vioxx was withdrawn from the market. The patients on narcotic analgesics with or without a COX-Z-selective
NSAID had a fourfold greater rate of falls or fractures than those on nonselective NSAIDs or COX-2-selective agents.
Dr. Cronstein noted that in his view the AHA guidelines are poorly done. The problem is one of tunnel vision. The guidelines focus on the evidence of increased cardiovascular risk associated with nearly all NSAIDs without considering how the drugs
stack up in terms of overall safety--noncardiovascular as well as cardiovascular--compared with the other major analgesic group: narcotic analgesics. And it turns out that the NSAIDs look pretty good in comparison, the rheumatologist added.
&quot;You&apos;re trading off falls and fractures for MIs--and it turns out that in patients over age 65, the mortality from hip fracture is significantly greater than it is for MI,&quot; said Dr. Cronstein, who is also director of the Clinical and Translational
Science Institute, which is a partnership between New York University and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation.
He cited a large Medicare study conducted by investigators at Brigham and Women&apos;s Hospital, Boston. They examined the comparative safety of analgesics in elderly arthritis patients and concluded that narcotic analgesics come up short.
The investigators sifted through the population of Medicare beneficiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to identify elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis (OA) who were started on a nonselective NSAID, a COX-2-selective
NSAID, or a narcotic analgesic during 1999-2005. They came up with 4,280 propensity score-matched patients in each of the three groups. The subjects&quot; mean age was 80 years, and 85% were women. Patients with prior cancer or nursing home use were excluded
from the study to avoid data skewing.
The composite incidence of fractures of the hip, pelvis, humerus, or radius in this National Institutes of Health-funded study was 26 per 1,000 person-years among patients on nonselective NSAIDs, 19 with COX-2-selective NSAIDs, and 101 with
opioids.
While it&apos;s not really surprising that opiate analgesics should be associated with increased risk of falls and fractures, another finding in this study proved unexpected: Intriguingly, the composite cardiovascular event rate was 77 per 1,000
person-years with nonselective NSAIDs, 88 per 1,000 with COX-2-selective NSAIDs, and 122 in the narcotic analgesics group.
The patients taking opioids had a 77% greater risk of cardiovascular events and those taking COX-2-selective NSAIDs had a 28% greater risk than did patients on nonselective NSAIDs, according to findings from a multivariate Cox regression analysis.
The fracture risk was 4.47-fold greater with narcotic analgesics than with NSAIDs. The gastrointestinal bleeding risk was 40% lower in the COX-2-selective NSAID group than in the other two study arms. The all-cause mortality risk was 87% greater in the
narcotic analgesic group than with nonselective NSAIDs, while COX-2-selective NSAIDs weren&apos;t associated with increased risk (Arch. Intern. Med. 2010;170:1968-78).
This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Geisinger Clinic, and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Dr. Cronstein reported that he has served as a paid consultant to Allos, Bristol-Myers Squibb, CanFite
Biopharmaceuticals, Cypress Laboratories, Gismo Therapeutics, Novartis, Protalex, Regeneron, and Savient.</TEXT>

<TI>Mortality higher in younger women with MI, no chest pain.(NEWS)</TI>
<TEXT>FROM JAMA
Among patients with myocardial infarction, women are more likely than men to present without chest pain or discomfort, and are more likely to die from the event, according to a report. However, these sex-based differences are most pronounced at
younger ages; they become attenuated and nearly disappear with increasing age, said Dr. John G. Canto of the Watson Clinic and Lakeland (Fla.) Regional Medical Center and his associates.
The investigators studied sex-related and age-related differences in MI patients using the &quot;large and clinically rich&quot; database of the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction. The industry-sponsored NRMI contains hospital data on over 2 million
patients with confirmed MI treated at 1,977 hospitals across the country between 1994 and 2006.
Dr. Canto and his colleagues analyzed NRMI data on 1,143,513 of these MI patients, of whom 42% were women. For this study, chest pain/discomfort was defined as &quot;any symptom of chest discomfort, sensation, or pressure, or tightness; or arm, neck,
or jaw pain ... preceding a diagnosis of acute MI.&quot;
Overall, 35.4% of the study subjects presented without chest pain. The proportion was significantly higher among women (42.0%) than men (30.7%), the researchers said (JAMA 2012;307:813-22).
However, this difference decreased in a linear fashion with increasing patient age. For MI patients younger than 45 years, the odds ratio was 1.30; at 45-54 years, it was 1.26; at 55-64 years, it was 1.24; at 65-74 years, it was 1.13; and at 75
years and older, it was 1.03, or practically negligible.
Mortality followed a similar trend within those age groups, but went further in the opposite direction, to a reversal in the oldest patients. The adjusted odds ratio of mortality in women presenting with no chest pain, compared with men presenting
with no chest pain, was 1.18 for those younger than age 45, 1.13 for those age 45-54, 1.02 for patients age 55-64, 0.91 at age 65-74, and 0.81 in the patients age 75 and older.
Comorbidity and clinical characteristics clearly accounted for most of the excess mortality in patients who did not have chest pain. These patients were more likely than those with chest pain to have diabetes, to have delayed seeking medical
attention at the onset of MI, to present with Killip class III or IV heart failure, and to have non-ST-elevation MI.
Differences in treatment accounted for only a modest amount of the excess mortality in patients who did not have chest pain. These patients were less likely to receive any reperfusion therapies, such as fibrinolysis or percutaneous coronary
intervention, and were less likely to receive aspirin, antiplatelet agents, heparin, or beta-blockers during hospitalization. But that was considered a relatively small contributor to their excess mortality.
The reasons for these sex- and age-based differences in symptoms remain unknown. &quot;It is plausible, or even likely, that the pathophysiology or pathobiology of higher mortality observed in younger women also accounts for the apparent differences in
MI symptom presentation in this premenopausal or middle-aged group,&quot; Dr. Canto and his associates said.
The NRMI was supported by Genentech. Dr. Canto&apos;s associates, but not Dr. Canto, reported ties to numerous industry sources.
VITALS
Major Finding: Younger women with MI who presented without chest pain had significantly greater hospital mortality than did younger men without chest pain (OR, 1.18 for age younger than 45), but the difference was reversed with age (OR, 0.81 for
age 75 and older).
Data Source: This was an observational analysis of data on 1,143,513 men and women with MI who were treated at 1,977 hospitals across the United States in 1994-2006.
Disclosures: The NRMI was supported by Genentech. Dr. Canto&apos;s associates, but not Dr. Canto, reported ties to numerous industry sources.</TEXT>

<TI>Active RVA wants you to move it</TI>
<TEXT>March 30--RICHMOND, Va. -- More than 40,000 people will lace up sneakers Saturday to run, walk or maneuver wheelchairs 6.2 miles in the popular 10K race along Richmond&apos;s Monument Avenue.
Many of them will be well-toned athletes who&apos;ll get to the finish line in a snap. Some will be first-timers who hope to use the weeks of training and the event itself to start being more active year-round.
On the other hand, there will be some people who just hope they don&apos;t forget there is a race so they can stay far away and not get snarled up in race-day detoured traffic. Get out and exercise? No thanks.
Sports Backers, the organization behind the Monument Avenue 10K, Dominion Riverrock and other high-profile sporting events, wants to get that latter group off the couch with the others and make the Metro Richmond area the most physically active
region in the country.
In an initiative called Active RVA, the organization will tout its signature events but also try to enlist government, schools, businesses and others on projects such as providing more paved paths for walking and biking and getting companies to
encourage employees to be more active.
&quot;The overriding goal is to increase the number of people that are physically active on a regular basis, ultimately to the point that our residents are the most physically active in our country,&quot; said Jon Lugbill, Sports Backers executive
director.
Exercise or physical activity, research shows, is good for your health, reducing risk of diabetes, helping manage stress and helping with weight control. A healthy community also can be good for business.
&quot;We say that an active, healthy workforce is a productive workforce, and when employees feel good and stay out of the doctor&apos;s office, they are more effective and focused, and insurance premiums do not rise,&quot; said Lesley Bruno, spokeswoman for the
Greater Richmond Chamber.
&quot;As a region, earning national recognition as a healthy and fit community helps attract companies and jobs as well as a talented workforce,&quot; she said.
The Richmond area is not doing so badly right now, Lugbill said. The American College of Sports Medicine in 2011 ranked the Richmond metro area 12th on a list of the 50 largest metro areas with strong community fitness. Minneapolis topped the
list.
&quot;Our ratings are really good, and compared to the rest of the Southeast, it&apos;s amazing. We&apos;re right in there with cities that everybody thinks are incredibly active, like Austin, Texas, and Salt Lake City,&quot; Lugbill said.
Lugbill said numerous outdoor events provide people with opportunities to be active.
&quot;I think our city&apos;s core is very pedestrian-friendly. We have a lot of sidewalks. A lot of our suburban development isn&apos;t, but a lot of suburban people will drive to their exercise. We also have a very strong infrastructure to support people being
active.&quot;
Richmond officials on April 28 will kick off a Healthy Richmond Campaign, with a day of activities designed to get people more active and focused on healthy lifestyles.
There also will be an annual fitness &quot;report card&quot; for the region that gauges progress, and Sports Backers hopes to offer a certification of sorts for businesses and agencies that meet activity goals.
The initiative also will address disparities in access to opportunities to be active. Some neighborhoods aren&apos;t safe to walk in. Some lack fitness centers.
&quot;The more we get people walking and running in the neighborhoods, the more they think it is normal and regular activity,&quot; Lugbill said. &quot;We want to have biking, walking and running established in all parts of the community.&quot;

<TEXT>By BAILEY DARROW HERALD-CITIZEN Staff BAXTER -- It wasn&apos;t really a job she thought she would enjoy. So, when Upperman High School principal Frank Medley asked Mary Hargis if she wanted to work part-time at the school, she was hesitant to accept
the offer. &quot;I thought I would not like working with high school students,&quot; Hargis said. &quot;I was so wrong. I loved it.&quot; That was 1988, 24 years ago. Hargis has been at the school since. She started out part-time in the cafeteria, running the cash register
and doing payroll, and later took on a second part-time position as an assistant in the school&apos;s library. Then, she started working full-time as the school&apos;s attendance secretary which she has done for many years. &quot;I love seeing all the students and the
teachers who come in and out of the office,&quot; Hargis said. She grew up in Baxter, attending Baxter Elementary School and Upperman High School.
When she married her husband, Kenneth Hargis, 36 years ago, she moved to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he was stationed. &quot;I had never been away from home a day in my life, so it was a big change for me,&quot; Hargis said. The couple lived in North
Carolina for about a year and a half before Mary came back to Baxter while Kenneth was stationed in Korea. When he returned, the couple lived in Alabama while Kenneth finished his time in the Army. &quot;We then moved back to Baxter after he finished his
time in the Army. We decided that transferring here and there was not the best thing for raising a family; so, we decided to come back home,&quot; she said. The couple has three children, Amanda Burkett, Annie Longmire, and Josh Hargis, though all grown and
married now, Hargis started out as a stay-at home mom. She earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in office management from Tennessee Tech. She worked as a substitute teacher and at First Tennessee Bank off and on while she was raising her children. &quot;I really
wished I had worked for my degree in education,&quot; Hargis said. &quot;I realized this later, but going back to school and with three little ones was not what I wanted to do.&quot; Though she never pursued education, she has an entire &quot;family&quot; of educators in the
UHS faculty. &quot;They truly are like my family since I am with them so many hours of the day,&quot; Hargis said. As the UHS secretary, Hargis is responsible for keeping daily attendance records, issuing admit slips to students who have been absent, signed out
early or arrive to school late. She arranges transportation for school trips, checks staff time sheets, enters student discipline reports into the computer, keeps up with the copy machine, greets people coming into the school office, and anything else
that comes up throughout the day. &quot;Really I just do a little this and a little that,&quot; she said. &quot;There are a lot of little jobs I do that just add up.&quot; The down side of being the first person people see when they walk into the building is that Hargis
often has to deal with people who are upset about things that she has no control over. &quot;Sometimes parents do come in upset over various situations and I am the first person they see and sometimes I am the sounding board,&quot; she said. &quot;Taking it
personally, I use to cry a lot because I never did handle that very well, but over the years I have learned that it really is not me they are angry at so I don&apos;t get as upset as I once did.&quot; There are certainly entertaining parts to Hargis&apos; job as well,
like the, sometimes outrageous, reasons students give for being absent from school. &quot;I just wish I had kept up with some of the crazy excuses I have gotten over the years for students being out,&quot; she said. &quot;I confess I have saved two of my all time
favorites. You would have to read them to believe them.&quot; Since Upperman is her alma mater and she loves basketball, Hargis goes to most UHS home basketball games and goes to all of her grandson&apos;s basketball games. She has six grandchildren: Daniel,
Libby Jo and Jaxson Hargis, Walker Burkett, and Noah and Kenlee Longmire and loves to cook for her family. &quot;I was raised to cook a big meal everyday and I have pretty much always done so,&quot; she said. &quot;I also like to decorate cakes but that does take a
lot of time and effort. Most of all, I love to be with my family.&quot; Family, she says, is the most important thing to her. &quot;I truly love my job,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a stressful job at times, but I can say there is never a dull moment. Times just flies when
you are having fun.&quot;</TEXT>

<TI>Quality of dyspnea directs diagnosis, treatment.(PULMONARY MEDICINE)(Disease/Disorder overview)</TI>
<TEXT>KEYSTONE, COLO. -- Understanding the quality of a patient&apos;s dyspnea provides insights into the underlying physiologic mechanism and can guide management, according to Dr. James T. Good Jr., a pulmonologist at National Jewish Health in Denver.
Complaints that may represent dyspnea can be as vague as fatigue, lack of energy, or simply getting old, but most commonly are a sensation of air hunger, of work or effort to breathe, or of chest tightness. All three sensations are the result of a
mismatch or neuromechanical dissociation between ongoing motor signals to the respiratory muscles and incoming afferent information from the lungs, chest wall, and upper airways, Dr. Good said.
For the patient who describes air hunger, the sensation can be equated to being held underwater and is often so distressing that patients say they would prefer pain to air hunger. The sensation is mediated primarfly through central and peripheral
chemoreceptors and stimulated by hypercapnia or hypoxia in the presence of decreased arterial carbon dioxide (C[O.sub.2]) partial pressure and oxygen partial pressure, Dr. Good said.
In the patient who describes work or effort when breathing, the sensation is stimulated by respiratory motor muscle contraction and muscle fatigue and is mediated through a combination of central motor discharge, chest wall receptors, and
metaboreceptors located within skeletal muscle, he said at the meeting, which was sponsored by National Jewish Health.
In patients with chest tightness, the sensation is stimulated by bronchoconstriction and tends to be mediated primarily through rapidly adapting stretch receptors (RARs) and C-fiber receptors in the pulmonary and respiratory tract. Chest tightness
can occur with other dyspneic sensations but is fairly specific to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
The first question to ask patients who present with complaints of an uncomfortable sensation associated with breathing is whether it occurs at rest or with exertion, Dr. Good suggested. Dyspnea at rest implies an acute illness or moderate to
severe cardiopulmonary disease. It also is very common in patients with anxiety, with or without underlying disease, and in patients with alterations in the respiratory drive. Dyspnea with exertion is most common in patients with cardiac dysfunction,
pulmonary diseases, metabolic disorders, deconditioning, obesity, and anemia.
The next important question to ask is whether the patient with dyspnea has normal oxygen saturation (Sa[O.sub.2]), he said. A normal Sa[O.sub.2] implies a mild disorder such as exercise-induced bronchospasm, while an abnormal SaO2 implies moderate
to severe cardiopulmonary disease if dyspnea occurs at rest, mild to moderate cardiopulmonary disease if dyspnea occurs during exercise, or sleep-disordered breathing if it occurs with sleep.
Dr. Good observed that many of his cardiology colleagues routinely obtain an electrocardiogram in their patients who are short of breath, which is an important part of the work-up, but that they overlook spirometry.
&quot;If a patient has dyspnea they need to have spirometry,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;You have to start with that. It is absolutely key.&apos;&quot;
Dyspneic patients with normal spirometry are unlikely to have significant underlying COPD or interstitial lung disease (ILD), but they could have exercise-induced bronchospasm, mild or persistent asthma, or vocal cord dysfunction.
If an obstructive pattern is observed on spirometry, this could be a clue to evaluate for COPD or asthma. A restrictive pattern on spirometry should raise suspicion for ILD, neuromuscular disease, chest wall abnormalities, pleural effusion, or
heart failure, he said.
Dr. Good presented several cases that highlighted the importance of a thorough work-up, including that of a 70-year-old retired engineer with increasing air hunger dyspnea on exertion. Spirometry revealed a normal forced expiratory volume in 1
second of 2.74 L, or 84% of predicted volume, and forced expiratory vital capacity of 4.91 L, or 111% of predicted volume. The [FEV.sub.1]/FVC ratio was 56%, which is low, but not enough to explain the amount of dyspnea the patient was experiencing.
Cardiac evaluation proved uneventful, but pulmonary function tests revealed a diffusion capacity of 17.2, or just 53% of predicted value.
Dr. Good said that pulmonologists frequently rely on diffusion capacity when spirometry is normal, and when values are less than 50% of predicted, patients are frequently dyspneic.
&quot;Once the dyspnea evaluation is complete, it is usually possible to determine all factors that are contributing to the patient&apos;s breathlessness and direct specific therapy&quot; to the underlying disease process, he said.
Other therapeutic approaches include conditioning, fitness, and weight loss in obese patients with dyspnea, as well as beta-agonists and anticholinergics, theophylline, opiates, and anxiolytics.
Dr. Good disclosed serving as an investigator and speaker for Genentech and as a speaker for Glaxo-SmithKline and Merck.

<TI>Severe anemia may triple mortality risk after stroke.(CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE)</TI>
<TEXT>NEW ORLEANS -- Patients with a very low or a very high hematocrit are at higher risk for death after a stroke, and anemic patients are at greatest risk, according to a study that was presented at the conference.
Previous studies have shown that extremes of hematocrit increase mortality after myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and kidney disease. Dr. Jason J. Sico of the VA Connecticut Healthcare System and researchers from the Department of
Veterans Affairs medical system explored whether there was a similar association in stroke. Previous stroke studies had not adjusted for stroke severity or a large number of comorbidities.
They found that &quot;among stroke patients, severe anemia is a potent predictor of dying throughout the first year after a stroke,&quot; said Dr. Sico, who is also an assistant professor of neurology at Yale University, New Haven, Conn.
The researchers abstracted medical records for a sample from 131 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals of 3,965 patients admitted for a confirmed diagnosis of ischemic stroke in fiscal 2007. Patients with unavailable hematocrits, those
who received thrombolytics, or those whose charts had inconsistent death dates were also excluded.
The hematocrit, taken from 24 hours of admission, was divided into six tiers: less than or equal to 27% (defined as severe anemia); 28%-32% (moderate anemia); 33%-37% (mild anemia); 38%-42% (normal); 43%-47% (normal); and greater than or equal to
48% (polycythemia).
Researchers adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, comorbidities (including pneumonia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and history of cancer and heart disease), and Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation (APACHE)-III scores.
A total of 2% of the 3,750 patients analyzed had severe anemia, 6.2% had moderate anemia, and 17.9% had mild anemia. About 64% were in the normal categories. A total of 9% had a high hematocrit of greater than or equal to 48%. People with lower
hematocrits tended to be older and have higher APACHE scores, a higher Charlson index, a history of heart disease, and were more likely to have diabetes.
The risk of death was 2.5 to 3.5 times higher for patients with severe anemia (P = .013 for in-hospital and 30-day mortality; P = .002 at 6 months and P = .001 at 1 year). A high hematocrit was independently associated only with in-hospital
mortality (OR 2.9, P = .004).
The study showed that having a history of severe anemia put stroke patients at a higher risk of death than having a history of other conditions, including cancer and heart disease, Dr. Sico said the meeting, which was sponsored by the American
Heart Association.
There are several potential mechanisms to explain why anemia might increase the risk of death, he said in an interview. With lower hematocrits, less blood and less oxygen circulate to various parts of the body. Long-term anemia also impairs the
ability of the brain&apos;s blood vessels to respond appropriately to a stroke.
A higher hematocrit also decreases blood flow to brain, said Dr. Sico. It causes a more turbulent blood flow to the brain, which could predispose the stroke patient to having a bad outcome.
Dr. Sico said that the study&apos;s findings were limited to men because no women had been analyzed.
Dr. Sico reported having no financial disclosures. The study was funded by the VA Health Services Research and Development Quality Enhancement Research Initiative.

<TI>UPDATE 1-German retail sales fall unexpectedly in February</TI>
<TEXT>* German real retail sales -1.1 pct m/m, +1.7 pct y/y-data
* Euro crisis, oil prices denting sentiment, say economists
(Adds details, background, quote)
By Sarah Marsh
BERLIN, March 30 (Reuters) - German retail sales fell unexpectedly in February, down 1.1 percent on a monthly basis in real terms, denting hopes that private consumption will support Europe&apos;s largest economy in the first quarter.
The notoriously volatile indicator has fallen four out of the last five months, contrasting with expectations for retail to hold up well in the light of a robust labour market. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales to rise 1.2
percent on the month.
&quot;The trend has been weak for a while now, which is most certainly down to the fact that households still do not believe in a sustainable solution to the euro zone crisis,&quot; said Christian Schulz at Berenberg Bank.
&quot;The fall in unemployment still does not seem to have had a sustainable impact on purchase behaviour, which is astonishing given that all the conditions are good, with interest rates rock bottom,&quot; he added.
Retail sales were up 1.7 percent on an annual basis, partly thanks to the extra day in February 2012, beating a consensus forecast for a gain of 0.1 percent.
January retail sales were revised upwards to a fall of 1.2 percent on the month, from a previously reported decrease of 1.6 percent. On an annual basis sales were also revised up, to a gain of 1.7 percent from a 1.6 percent gain.
Germany&apos;s economy recovered quickly from the global financial crisis of 2008/09 but shrank by 0.2 percent at the end of last year as the euro zone&apos;s debt troubles and a global slowdown took a toll on exports and private consumption.
The economy has seemed to pick up slightly this year, leading some institutes to hike their growth forecasts and many economists to predict stable or rising output in the first three months of 2012, thereby avoiding the two successive quarters of
contraction that define a recession.
A strong labour market has helped prop up consumer confidence, which has risen six out of seven months according to market research group GfK. The jobless rate dropped to a new post-reunification low of 6.7 percent in March.
DOWNBEAT RETAILERS
Yet consumer morale unexpectedly eased heading into April and German retailers have been relatively downbeat about the outlook for this year, a worrying sign given that many economists hope domestic demand will support the economy at a time when
foreign demand for exports is uncertain.
Fashion house Hugo Boss AG said this month sales growth will halve this year, cooled by a likely slowdown in Chinese demand for designer labels, while Metro, the world&apos;s fourth-largest retailer, has forecast flat profits.
Economists said rising oil prices was one factor unsettling consumers.
&quot;The uncertainty due to high oil prices will most probably continue for a while as we are heading into the holiday weeks when petrol prices generally rise,&quot; said Stefan Schilbe of HSBC Trinkaus. &quot;They reduce purchasing power.&quot;
He added however that it was not yet time to write off private consumption: &quot;The labour market is in excellent form and wage negotiations seem likely to result in relatively high wage hikes.&quot;
Falling unemployment has emboldened trade unions to demand higher wages after years of restrained pay growth which boosted Germany&apos;s competitiveness and helped cut joblessness.
The Verdi and IG Metall unions are both asking for 6.5 percent wage rises for some five million workers in total.
Germany&apos;s HDE retail association on Thursday reiterated its forecast for nominal sales growth of 1.5 percent for the full year.

<TI>&apos;Big Chomp&apos; kicks off company&apos;s research park expansion</TI>
<TEXT>March 30--A trackhoe with a giant, mechanical claw started tearing apart the BioTech 3 building in the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park on Thursday, as a crowd of onlookers enjoyed wine and hors d&apos;oeuvres from the top of a nearby parking
deck.
The mood was celebratory because the leveling of the building at Fifth and Jackson streets is part of a big expansion project for Health Diagnostic Laboratory Inc., a fast-growing company that is adding hundreds of jobs in downtown Richmond.
&quot;To our surprise and our pleasure, we have been expanding a little bit faster than expected,&quot; Health Diagnostic President and chief executive Tonya Mallory told the guests at an event the company dubbed &quot;The Big Chomp,&quot; which included a jazz band
and refreshments beneath a tent on the parking deck.
Health Diagnostic provides diagnostic testing for physicians around the country to detect early risk factors for such conditions as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The company also provides health counseling to patients to help reduce their
risk of developing those diseases.
The company started out less than three years ago with just a handful of employees in a 10,000-square-foot office and lab in the research park. The company now has 487 employees, and it expects to reach 850 by 2014.
Mallory said the company has 57 job openings right now. &quot;They&apos;re across the board -- lots of different positions,&quot; including medical billing, lab assistants, health counselors and human resources staff, she said.
The company&apos;s $68.5 million, two-phase expansion will involve demolishing two buildings along Jackson and North Fifth streets in the research park -- BioTech 3 and BioTech 5. Those buildings are across Jackson Street from Altria Group Inc.&apos;s
Center for Research and Technology.
The BioTech 3 and BioTech 5 buildings will be replaced with two six-story structures. They will connect with Health Diagnostic&apos;s existing home in the three-story BioTech 8 on North Fifth Street.
Equity partners in the development include Health Diagnostic, the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park, McKinney &amp; Co. and Lingerfelt Development.
&quot;It&apos;s a good economic return. HDL is a great company,&quot; said Al Lingerfelt, a principal at Lingerfelt Development, a real estate development firm based in Henrico County.
The first phase of the Health Diagnostic project is expected to be complete in December, with the construction of the second six-story building to begin in 2013. The project architect is McKinney &amp; Co., and the contractor is The Whiting-Turner
Contracting Co.
Robert T. Skunda, president and CEO of the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park, said the expansion will bring total development of the park to 1.2 million square feet and will push total employment to more than 2,500 jobs in the next two years.

<TI>CNY ASTHMA RATE ABOVE AVERAGE</TI>
<TEXT>More than one in 10 Central New York adults have asthma, a higher rate than the state average, according to a report released last week.
The report by Excellus BlueCross BlueShield shows 11.4 percent of Central New Yorkers ages 18 to 64 have the lung disease that involves inflammation of the airways. The state average is 9.7 percent.
The highest prevalence of asthma Upstate is in the Finger Lakes region, where 13.4 percent of 18- to 64-year-olds have the condition. The Southern Tier had the lowest rate, 10.2 percent.
Women, blacks, 18- to 24-year-olds and adults making less than $15,000 annually are at the highest risk of developing asthma in Upstate New York, according to the report.
The lung disease causes repeated episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and nighttime or early morning coughing. Asthma can be controlled by taking medicine and avoiding the triggers that can cause an attack.
The report says the disease affects 1.4 million adults in New York, including 94,644 people in Central New York.
The true number of Central New Yorkers with asthma is much higher. That&apos;s because the Excellus report is based on surveys of adults conducted from 2008 through 2010 by the state Health Department and does not include children.
Asthma is more common in children than adults. Nationally, nearly one in 13 school-age children has asthma, and the rate is rising more rapidly in preschool children and those living in inner cities than in any other group.</TEXT>

<TI>NCDEX turmeric rises support at Rs.4130 4170: Angel</TI>
<TEXT>India, March 30 -- Turmeric prices in the intraday are likely to witness uptrend due to improved buying at support levels. However prices in the short term (April) are expected to remain down due to peak arrival period and dull demand from the
domestic and overseas buyers. In the medium to long term (May June) prices are expected to track demand from the overseas and domestic buyers. If prices fall below 3800/qtl farmers might start hoarding the stocks and may not sell at lower levels thereby
supporting prices to strengthen. Turmeric NCDEX Apr Futures Rs/qtl support: 4130 4170 resistance: 4276 4300 Looking for a trading partner? visit commodityonline.com/franchiseePublished by HT Syndication with permission from Commodity Online.</TEXT>
