      <description>It's official: it's getting windier down south. This unexpected quirk of climate change has given a much needed boost to offshore wind-farm developers. &#xD;
&#xD;
For those struggling to make the economics of hugely expensive wind farms work, more wind equals more money. &#xD;

      <description>E.ON posts significantly higher earnings, demonstrating strength in the current economic crisis. In a very difficult environment, E.ON increased its 2008 adjusted EBIT by 7,3 percent to ?9.9 billion. This result is in line with the forecast E.ON issued in the spring of 2007 before the economic crisis began. Sales were up 26 percent to ?86.8 billion. Adjusted net income, the earnings figure E.ON uses to determine its dividend, rose by 9 percent to ?5.6 billion. Management will propose raising the dividend to ?1.50 per registered share, resulting in a payout ratio of just over 50 percent.</description>

      <description>Faltering plans for Britain to become a leader in green energy received a boost with measures to aid investment in renewables and a binding target to reduce carbon emissions by more than a third over the coming decade. &#xD;
&#xD;
Claiming that an economic recovery must be ?sustainable and protect the environment?, Alistair Darling announced that up to £4.5 billion of extra funding ? the bulk of it from the European Investment Bank ? would be made available to help to build offshore wind parks. Many of these schemes have stalled because of their cost, the credit crunch and the weakening of sterling.</description>

      <description>Two breaking stories neatly illustrate the flawed logic which still lurks at the heart of UK energy policy. First up is that German energy utility RWE's bid to build a new nuclear plant near Kirksanton in Cumbria will mean dismantling an existing wind farm on the site. While at the other end of the country, 600 workers at the Vestas Blades wind turbine factory on the Isle of Wight could be facing redundancy.</description>

      <description>Siemens intends to rigorously expand its world-leading position as a supplier of ecofriendly products and solutions.   &#xD;
&#xD;
The move to a green economy is a huge opportunity for us,? said Siemens President and CEO Peter Löscher at the company?s Semiannual Press Conference in Berlin. In his speech, Löscher referred to the statements of German President Horst Köhler who, in his fourth Berlin address, called for an ?environmental, industrial revolution. Technological revolutions have always been our specialty. That's why no one is better equipped to lead the green revolution than Siemens. As a green infrastructure giant, the company is a reliable, long-term partner worldwide due to its experience, technological expertise and solid financial position, added Löscher. The technologies in Siemens? Environmental Portfolio already generate sales of roughly 19 billion, accounting for about one-quarter of the company's total revenue.</description>

      <title>Layoffs Blow Through The Largest Wind Maker, Vestas</title>

      <description>When the CEO of the world?s No. 1 turbine maker, Vestas, said earlier this year that the global downturn was slashing demand for its products, it seemed like only a matter of time before the company would respond with cuts. The rest of the wind industry hasn?t been shy about layoffs. Well, here it is: Vestas is cutting 1,900 jobs ? 9 percent of its work force ? largely in the UK (closing a turbine plant on the Isle of Wight) and Denmark.</description>

      <title>Interim financial report, first quarter 2009</title>
      <link>http://www.vestas.com/files//Filer/EN/Investor/Company_announcements/2009/090428_CA_UK_09.pdf</link>
      <description>Vestas generated first-quarter revenue of EUR 1,105m, an increase of 58 per cent, achieving an EBIT improvement of 124 per cent to EUR 76m and lifting the EBIT margin from 4.9 per cent to 6.9 per cent. Net working capital stood at 8 per cent of expected annual revenue, against 2 per cent in Q1 2008. The increase was significantly attributable to larger inventories. The order backlog of firm and unconditional orders amounted to EUR 4.9bn at 31 March 2009. Full-year expectations for 2009 are still for an EBIT margin of 11-13 per cent on revenue of EUR 7.2bn. At the end of the first quarter of 2009, Vestas? total undrawn financial facilities amounted to EUR 850m. Vestas continues to expand its operations in the USA and China owing to the positive market prospects. Capacity will be reduced in Northern Europe, as demand in this area at the moment does not meet expectations. Consequently, Vestas expects to lay off approx 1,900 employees in the production units in Northern Europe, primarily in Denmark and England. As a result of these measures, expected investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reduced by EUR 200m to EUR 1.0bn. The British Government?s commitment of 21 April 2009 regarding massive investments in wind power and higher tariffs, will have a positive influence on Vestas? possibilities of producing blades in Great Britain.</description>

      <description>The ocean is getting crowded: Fishermen are competing with offshore wind projects, oil rigs along with sand miners, recreational boaters, liquefied gas tankers and fish farmers. So a growing number of groups -- including policymakers, academics, activists and industry officials -- now say it's time to divvy up space in the sea.</description>

      <title>Lake Erie turbines costly but feasible</title>
      <link>http://www.zanesvilletimesrecorder.com/article/20090503/NEWS01/905030332</link>
      <description>Energy researchers say the winds blowing across Lake Erie can power wind turbines, but the project won't be cheap.A study released Friday showed it will cost $77 million to $92 million to build several turbines and a nearby wind research center to be run by Case Western Reserve University. Earlier estimates had put the price tag at about $60 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
The world's first freshwater turbines would stand some 260 feet above the water level and produce up to five megawatts of power each - enough to power up to 5,000 homes. Visible from downtown Cleveland, they would be built 3 to 5 miles offshore.</description>

      <link>http://www.electricnet.com/article.mvc/Siemens-Puts-Medium-Voltage-Switchgear-0001?VNETCOOKIE=NO</link>
      <description>Siemens Energy has developed the new gas-insulated medium-voltage switchgear NX Plus C Wind. The gas insulated switchgear deployed by Siemens to date for wind turbines operated at a voltage of 24 kilovolts (kV). The new NX Plus C Wind switchgear operates at a voltage of 36 kV. It is also of a more compact design than the previously built 36-kV Siemens switchgear and can be readily accommodated in the tower of a wind turbine.</description>

      <description>A nagging issue wound its way through the chatter at what was an otherwise celebratory event for the nation's wind industry in Chicago. &#xD;
&#xD;
The U.S. has become the world's biggest generator of wind power. Of the electricity production added in the country last year, 42 percent came from wind turbines. But as more megawatts come on line, the problem of getting power from wind-swept plains to places where people actually live becomes more urgent.</description>

      <description>The wind power industry has not been able to escape the effects of the&#xD;
global financial crisis. Most major companies,both manufacturers and project&#xD;
developers, have downgraded their expectations for growth in the coming&#xD;
year. Some have even been forced to lay off staff. But the underlying prognosis is&#xD;
that the wind market will continue to expand at an impressive rate, consolidating&#xD;
its position as the most dynamic global renewable energy source.</description>

      <link>http://www.powergeneration.siemens.com/press/press-releases/renewable-energy/2009/ERE200905047.htm</link>
      <description>Siemens is greatly expanding its wind power activities in Germany and Europe. As part of this expansion, Siemens has now established its European headquarters for wind power sales and project execution in Hamburg. At the same time, the Bremen location is being upgraded to European headquarters in the service business. The new headquarters in Hamburg is starting up operations with about 40 employees. As a result, employees with functions in sales and project execution have relocated to Hamburg from Brande in Denmark and, in some cases, from Bremen. In the medium term, about 70 jobs are expected to be created at Siemens Wind Powers new Hamburg location.</description>

      <title>Outdated electrical grid needs to be smarter</title>
      <link>http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2009/05/12/cunninghamed_0512.html</link>
      <description>For the first time in seven decades, a U.S. president has drawn attention to the need for investment in the electrical grid: this time in expanding and modernizing an established grid. Franklin Roosevelt, as part of a larger effort to address the Great Depression, dramatically increased public spending, investing in electrification of rural areas. Now decades later, President Barack Obama has assumed office in the midst of another dismal economy. The federal government is providing billions of public dollars, including a $4.5 billion investment in the transmission grid. Utilities across the country had invested $200 billion in generation of electricity over the past decade, while only about $40 billion in new transmission. These investment levels were seriously out of balance even before the current emphasis on developing renewable sources of generation such as wind power.</description>

      <title>Offshore Wind Energy Set to Boom in the Next Few Years Finds Frost &amp; Sullivan</title>
      <link>http://www.newswiretoday.com/news/50910/</link>
      <description>As the onshore market continues to grow in certain regions and move slowly towards saturation in others, offshore wind is expected to form a greater part of the pie from the meagre 2% that it is now. Onshore wind will always occupy a major share of the wind energy market. However, Frost &amp; Sullivan expects offshore wind to grow from an insignificant part of the pie to a more substantial contributor of electricity generated from wind by 2020. According to Frost &amp; Sullivan estimates, installed capacity of offshore wind is expected to grow from 1,276 MW in 2008 to 18,769 MW by 2015.</description>

Spain's wind power sector is the world's third-biggest producer and says it is key to meeting EU renewable energy targets by 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
The current subsidy scheme is due to expire in 2012, but producers say a new law enacted last week did not specify whether new wind farms will receive aid after 2010, when total generation capacity is expected to reach government targets.</description>

      <link>http://www.iberdrola.es/webibd/gc/prod/en/comunicacion/notasprensa/090422_NP_01_PR1T_en.pdf</link>
      <description>IBERDROLA recorded a net profit of €793 million in the first quarter of 2009, a fall of 34.2% over the same period last year, due to sharply lower extraordinary gains and declining business in Spain affected by falling demand and lower prices. Ordinary income, excluding gains from asset sales, increased by 0.4%.&#xD;
Diversification by region and by business over recent years enabled the Company to offset lower income in Spain and achieve a 9% rise in Ebitda to €1,952 million. The contribution of ScottishPower, Energy East and IBERDROLA RENOVABLES has been key to sustaining business in a negative economic climate.</description>

Its three segments (energy company Eneco, infrastructure company Joulz and network company Stedin), each having its own mission, contribute to substantiating the leading principles of the sustainability strategy: sustainable, decentralised and together with customers and partners. Greenpeace elected Eneco to be the cleanest energy company in 2008.</description>

      <title>Prediction Of Waves, Wakes and Offshore Wind</title>
      <link>http://powwow.risoe.dk/publ/BarthelmieEtAl-POW'WOW-WakesInShort-termForecasting.pdf</link>
      <description>In most wind farms, the layout of the turbines is evaluated to quantify the power loss due to wind turbine wakes. As wind farms increase in size it has become evident that wake losses in large offshore wind farms are under-predicted (sometimes known as the deep array effect). Hence there are a number of research projects underway to evaluate the cause of these discrepancies and to operationalise new models or modify existing models. A major issue is that wind farm data are confidential and that to date relatively few operators have been willing to allow access in order that models can be evaluated/improved. A further issue is that the comparison of data with models is not straightforward.</description>

      <description>Many indicators show that clean techs may lead any potential worldwide economic recovery. For example, since 2005 many of the leaders in turbine manufacturing have opened U.S. facilities; of the top 10 global suppliers in 2007, seven — Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY.PK), GE (GE) , Gamesa (GCTAF.PK), Suzlon Energy, Siemens (SI), Acciona (ACXIF.PK), and Nordex (NRDXF.PK) — have an American manufacturing presence. (The other three — Enercon, Goldwind, and Sinovel — do not yet sell into the U.S. market.) In addition, the homegrown Clipper Windpower (CRPWF.PK) has joined GE Energy as a major domestic player in the production of utility-scale turbines, with the two companies together capturing 50% of the 2008 domestic market.</description>

      <description>The Siemens Corp. says it never seriously looked at the Wichita metro area when it was deciding where to place the plant, which will employ 400 people in an industrial park in Hutchinson. The German company had been looking for a location in the heart of the country that could reduce shipping costs for its 90-ton nacelles, the structures that house the gearbox, drive train and control electronics on wind turbines. That product is manufactured in Europe.</description>

      <description>A nagging issue wound its way through the chatter at what was an otherwise celebratory event for the nation's wind industry in Chicago last week.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The U.S. has become the world's biggest wind-power generator and of the electricity production added in the country last year, 42 percent came from wind turbines. But as more megawatts come on line, the problem of getting power from wind-swept plains to places where people actually live becomes more urgent.</description>

      <description>Vestas continued its growth in 2008 with the biggest fourth quarter ever – a revenue of EUR 2,481m&#xD;
with an EBIT margin of 15.4 per cent compared to a revenue of EUR 1,884m and an EBIT margin of&#xD;
12.3 per cent in fourth quarter 2007. Total revenue in 2008 rose to EUR 6,035m from EUR 4,861m in&#xD;
2007. At the same time, EBIT margin increased to 11.1 per cent from 9.1 per cent the year before&#xD;
From the end of 2007 to the end of 2008, net working capital rose by EUR 367m to EUR 299m&#xD;
equivalent to 5 per cent of revenue. The increase is due to increased stocks and receivables. The&#xD;
latter is due to the large shipments at the end of the year. Cash flow from operations amounted to&#xD;
EUR 277m against EUR 701 in 2007. The growth in Vestas’ underlying profitability is expected to&#xD;
continue in 2009, however, at a lower rate than realised during the last three years.</description>

      <link>http://www.powergeneration.siemens.com/press/press-releases/renewable-energy/2009/ERE200902027.htm</link>
      <description>Siemens Energy has entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to conduct atmospheric modeling research that is expected to help operators and owners operate wind farms more efficiently, while providing more power to power grids. Under the CRADA that will span two years, Livermore will provide high-resolution, numerical weather prediction models to forecast power generated by the wind. Siemens will translate Livermore’s forecasts of wind speed and wind direction at each turbine into power collected.</description>

      <title>Statkraft – Q1 2009 - Satisfactory result from operations</title>
      <link>http://www.statkraft.com/pro/press/Press_releases/2009/statkraft_first_q.asp</link>
      <description>The Group posted an operating profit, adjusted for unrealised changes in value and material non-recurring items, of NOK 3 943 million in the first quarter of 2009 (NOK 3 838 million). This represents an improvement of 3% compared with the same period in 2008. The improvement in the operating result is primarily attributable to an increase in production as a result of the acquisition of new assets, while the average Nordic system price was on a par with the previous year. Adjusted for unrealised changes in value and material non-recurring items, the underlying profit after tax amounted to NOK 1 786 million (NOK 2 943 million). The interim financial statements are impacted by large unrealised changes in value. Unadjusted for these items, the accounting profit after tax was NOK 2 723 million (NOK 3 803 million)1.</description>

      <description>The Supervisory Board of DONG Energy A/S has today approved the interim financial report for the first quarter of 2009, which developed as follows compared with the first-quarter 2008 results:&#xD;
- Revenue was up 4% at DKK 15,616 million, primarily as a result of higher gas production from the Ormen Lange field. However, this was partly offset by significantly lower oil and gas prices and lower power prices&#xD;
- EBITDA was down 17% at DKK 2,653 million, substantially due to the effects of timing differences in connection with the huge fluctuations in market prices for, especially, oil, gas and coal&#xD;
- Profit after tax was DKK 718 million versus DKK 1,252 million&#xD;
- DONG Energy invested DKK 2.9 billion in new activities and existing plants, including a gas-fired power station project in Wales. In addition, a contract for the acquisition of a Polish wind farm was entered into</description>

      <title>R.I. offshore wind farm will likely be out of sight</title>
      <link>http://www.projo.com/news/content/wind_turbines_offshore_05-24-09_HAEAKJ4_v31.2ff99cf.html</link>
      <description>Because of stronger winds and a sea floor with fewer obstacles to construction, the most favorable places for wind turbines in Rhode Island coastal waters appear to be far offshore, where the turbines will be all but invisible from the mainland.&#xD;
&#xD;
That preliminary conclusion by state researchers could be extremely good news for Deepwater Wind, the company selected by the Carcieri administration to construct a $1.5-billion wind farm in Rhode Island’s coastal waters.</description>

      <description>The ocean is getting crowded: Fishermen are competing with offshore wind projects, oil rigs with sand miners, recreational boaters, liquefied gas tankers and fish farmers. So a number of groups — including policymakers, academics, activists and industry officials — say it’s time to divvy up space in the sea.</description>

      <title>Lehrer: The way the political winds are blowing, coastal insurance rates could go up</title>
      <link>http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/05/21/0521lehrer_edit.html</link>
      <description>As it girds for hurricane season, Texas has plenty to worry about. The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA)—which provides coverage for high risk coastal properties — has ended up at the brink of insolvency paying Hurricane Ike claims. Insurers operating near the coasts have begun to cut back on coverage and make noises about leaving the state. If that wasn't enough, some members of Congress now want to change tax law in a way that will drive already expensive coastal Texas insurance premiums even higher. The tax law change involves something called "offshore affiliated reinsurance" — a rather esoteric product that matters a lot here in Texas.</description>

      <title>Big rotors king for 2010+</title>
      <link>http://www.windmeup.org/</link>
      <description>A few years back, it was quite common to see various turbine manufacturers releasing their latest Class IA turbine, followed rather quickly with a class II and III rotor. This was typically just a longer blade with minimal nacelle changes. The Vestas 2WM, Siemens 2.3 MW, and GE 1.5 MW platforms are good examples of this.</description>

      <description>SCOTTISH NORTH Sea zones earmarked for offshore wind farms have the potential to produce 40% more electricity than their English equivalents, new research has found.&#xD;

The study by Edinburgh-based Atmos Consulting and the US space agency Nasa, which follows up on related findings published in the Sunday Herald last month, also indicates for the first time substantial variations in the electricity-generating potential of different areas of the same offshore zone.</description>

      <description>Various windfarm projects have been in the news recently, with the usual statistics of 'x' MW capacity to supply enough electricity for 'y' thousands of homes. The 'greens' love them; the sceptics emphasise the low utilisation factors. But nowhere is it possible to assess whether they will actually, overall, reduce CO2 levels.</description>

      <link>http://w1.siemens.com/press/pool/de/pressemitteilungen/2009/renewable_energy/ERE200906064e.pdf</link>
      <description>StatoilHydro and Siemens installed the world’s first large-scale floating wind turbine. The turbine is located approximately 12 km south east of Karmøy in Norway at a water depth of about 220 meters. The Hywind project was developed by StatoilHydro, and Siemens supplied the SWT-2.3 MW wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 82 meters. Over the next two years the floating wind turbine will be tested to provide a thorough analysis of this innovative concept. The Hywind turbine will be connected to the local grid and is expected to start producing power in mid-July.</description>

      <title>Europe's onshore and offshore wind energy potential</title>
      <link>http://www.enviro-solutions.com/dailynews/080609-eea-wind-energy-rpt.htm</link>
      <description>The European Environment Agency has published its report - Europe's onshore and offshore wind energy potential.&#xD;
This report provides a Europe-wide resource assessment of onshore and offshore wind potential in a geographically explicit manner. &#xD;
In addition to calculating raw wind resource potential, this study also introduces and quantitatively analyses the environmental and social constraints on wind sector development. &#xD;
Concerns addressed include the noise and visual impact of wind power, as well as the deaths of birds and bats that fly into rotor blades. &#xD;
The report also evaluates the future costs of wind energy production across Europe in order to gauge the potential output at competitive rates.</description>

      <description>IN THE “Online” column (Times &amp; Star, May 22) a Mr Donnelly offers views on wind turbines.&#xD;
&#xD;
He writes that wind turbines for the proposed second Solway offshore wind farm would operate at capacity around 35 per cent of the time, maybe more.&#xD;
&#xD;
British Wind Energy Association publicity on wind turbines indicates that rated output is achieved at wind speeds equating to ‘near gale’ on the Beaufort scale (around 33.5mph).</description>

      <description>Many of the nations within the area of consideration are emerging&#xD;
nations bounding on Europe with renewable potentials far in excess of national demand. Due to this circumstance, the&#xD;
possibilities of wide-area interconnection promise unprecedented economic and technical benefits for all participating&#xD;
nations. The investigations have confirmed that a totally renewable electricity supply is well within the range of current&#xD;
technology, delivering the electricity at costs if at all only slightly above the current cost of electricity even if future&#xD;
equipment cost reductions are neglected.</description>

This is a timely step underpinning the integration of large quantities of wind power in Europe, believes the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA). The BEMIP is a step towards a future pan-European electricity grid in the Baltic region, and extends the successful Nordic electricity market rules to the three Baltic States.</description>

      <title>Denmark to power electric cars by wind in vehicle-to-grid experiment</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jun/19/denmark-wind-electric-cars</link>
      <description>Cars could be the solution to the intermittent nature of wind power if a multimillion European project beginning on a Danish island proves successful.&#xD;
The project on the holiday island of Bornholm will use the batteries of parked electric cars to store excess energy when the wind blows hard, and then feed electricity back into the grid when the weather is calm</description>

      <title>Tilting at windmills may be costly for taxpayers</title>
      <link>http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/tilting-at-windmills-may-be-costly-for-taxpayers-1774516.html</link>
      <description>THIS report concludes that an investment of €14.75bn in wind energy projects would also be capable of supporting in excess of 10,500 jobs up to 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
This may indeed be true, but what about beyond 2020?&#xD;
&#xD;
Deloitte and others may be able to pin down a figure for investment, and extrapolate job numbers from this quite accurately, but no one can claim to accurately call the true cost of an energy grid which by then will be hugely reliant on wind as our renewable power source.</description>

This is not about the merits or demerits of the project. The appeal is about the ability of a state board, made up of nine gubernatorial appointees, to overrule a regional authority simply because the project developer submitted an application to the Cape Cod Commission.</description>

      <description>Yet another study shows that a shift away from traditional polluting jobs to those that fall into the so-called low carbon category is already occurring and will help Europe battle its way out of the current recession.&#xD;
&#xD;
Called ‘Low carbon jobs for Europe’, the WWF publication released last week indicates that about 3.4 million jobs in Europe are related directly to renewable energies, sustainable transportation and energy efficient goods and services, compared with 2.8 million jobs in polluting industries like mining, electricity, gas, cement, iron and steel</description>

      <link>http://www.energypulse.net/centers/article/article_display.cfm?a_id=2078</link>
      <description>More than 8,300 MW of wind plants were installed last year, comprising about 42 percent of all new electric capacity added in 2008. Nevertheless, myths continue to persist about wind, including that wind does not reduce fossil fuel use and associated emissions and, related to that, myths about the need for "backup power" from fossil fuel power plants. In reality, each megawatt-hour (MWh) produced by a wind plant replaces a MWh that would have been produced by another power plant.</description>

      <description>For CBI Scotland to support the Beauly to Denny power line, apparently without condition, demonstrates myopic and lamentable short-termism. The Scottish Government is rightly promoting the potential for Scotland to exploit renewable sources of electricity generation in Scotland, particularly from on- and offshore wind turbines, and wave sources. John Swinney, the Finance Secretary, in launching the Renewable Action Plan last week, said the "pace of change requires a constantly evolving framework". Every effort should be encouraged to support and exploit opportunities to develop a long-term industrial base to harvest these natural resources.</description>

      <description>The Obama administration has made offshore wind energy a priority and an important part of its plans to create jobs and combat climate change, but even such favorable political breezes have not been strong enough to propel the nation's first projects. &#xD;
The economy has intervened, and an unfamiliar federal approval process could hold up leading projects.</description>

      <description>Our current electrical grid system is ill suited to handle the variability of new sources of electrical power. Solving the transition to new power sources is only half the battle. After generating the power, you need to distribute it to where it is needed at the right time, in the right amounts and at a lower cost.</description>

      <link>http://www.publicservice.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=10079&amp;topic=Sustainable%20futures</link>
      <description>There's too much emphasis on wind power in the government's plans to combat climate change, the Confederation of British Industry has said. instead, there should be a greater emphasis on nuclear power and so-called 'clean coal'. However, Greenpeace has said that nuclear power is less effective than wind power at tackling global warming.</description>

      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/13/energy-cbi-wind-nuclear</link>
      <description>Against the backdrop of the worldwide economic downturn, it is ironic that the area often said to have the least business certainty, the renewables sector, is one of the few success stories. Globally this industry is bucking the trends, creating millions of new green jobs, increasing countries' energy independence and reducing climate-changing emissions. So it is scandalous that the CBI should come out attacking the prime minister and the climate change secretary Ed Miliband's commitment to boosting this industry in Britain just days before the launch of a fresh government initiative.</description>

      <title>New GE Technology Boosts Wind Turbine Output, Increasing Revenue for Wind Farm Operators</title>
      <link>http://www.gepower.com/about/press/en/2009_press/050409d.htm</link>
      <description>GE Energy today introduced the WindBOOST™ control system upgrade, designed to increase the output of its 1.5sle wind turbine—one of the most widely used machines in the global wind industry—resulting in greater revenues for wind farm operators&#xD;
The WindBOOST™ control system upgrade enables the turbine blades to spin faster and can increase the turbine output by 100 kilowatts, from 1.5 to 1.6 megawatts. By generating more power from the same unit, turbine operators can increase their profitability. Depending on the wind and other site conditions, the new feature has the potential to increase annual revenues up to $15,000 per unit.</description>

      <description>As ministers have sounded the fanfare for hundreds of thousands of “green jobs”, the demise of the Vestas wind turbine plant on the Isle of Wight has provided a mocking counterpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
The closure of one factory with the loss of 600 jobs does not in itself say much about the success or failure of the government’s strategy. However, the decision by Vestas is an uncomfortable reminder that the vision of a vibrant industry growing up to meet the challenge of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for Britain and the world is little more than an aspiration.</description>

      <description>The Cape Cod resort area, famous for sandy beaches and centuries-old fishing villages, could in the next few years claim a new title of home to the United States' first offshore wind farm.&#xD;
&#xD;
The US experienced a surge in investment in wind power over the past four years, more than tripling its ability to turn wind into electricity. But construction has been entirely on land and largely in America's rural midsection – leaving open the costly challenge of how to transmit power to the densely populated coasts where it is most needed.</description>

      <link>http://www.energychinaforum.com/news/24891.shtml</link>
      <description>CHINA has standardized tariffs for wind power projects to ensure profitability for the plants after a survey showed that some of them suffered losses.&#xD;
&#xD;
The standard tariffs replace a public tendering system as the survey conducted by the nation's electricity regulator revealed that the wind power plants suffered low profit margins, or even losses, due to low utilization rates under the public bidding system.</description>

      <title>Update on the Situation at Vestas’ Blade Factory on the Isle of Wight, UK</title>
      <link>http://www.oilvoice.com/n/Update_on_the_Situation_at_Vestas_Blade_Factory_on_the_Isle_of_Wight_UK/8efd80eae.aspx</link>
      <description>On 28 April 2009, Vestas announced it expected to lay off approximately 1,900 employees at the company’s production units in Northern Europe, primarily in Denmark and UK, as part of a wider capacity reduction strategy in Northern Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
The announcement was made in response to conditions in the Northern European markets not having met the company’s expectations. The current market conditions are caused by the credit crunch, weak currencies and a lack of local political action in certain markets. At the same time, Vestas is investing in a significant production base in the US. The expansion in the US has created substantial excess production capacity in Northern Europe, which has so far also manufactured turbines for the US market. Unfortunately, demand on the Northern European market cannot absorb the excess capacity.</description>

      <description>A year ago today, T. Boone Pickens brought his crusade for energy independence to Kansas, including to the offices of The Eagle editorial board. The economy would later take some of the air out of the effort, as would lower oil and gas prices. Many have questioned Pickens' motives. But he's had an undeniable impact, converting many people to the cause of breaking the nation's $700 billion-a-year addiction to foreign energy.</description>

      <title>Britain's low-carbon bonanza will go to foreign firms</title>
      <link>http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/utilities/article6736018.ece</link>
      <description>The government has put wind energy at the centre of its plans to remake Britain’s energy infrastructure. Crucially, though, the bane of the industry — planning — remains unresolved. The average onshore windfarm takes two years to get planning approval, one of Vestas’ biggest complaints. The government’s new Infrastructure Planning Commission, which will decide on big applications, should help speed up offshore wind projects but won’t help onshore developers. The commission can only decide on projects of 50MW or greater; the average onshore project is 30MW. Furthermore, the Tories have opposed the planning commission and have vowed to overhaul it.</description>

      <description>One of the first R&amp;D grants to a renewable-energy developer from the economic-stimulus funds approved by Congress this spring could have a dramatic impact on the design of wind turbines. The $16 million loan guarantee offered by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to Berkeley, CA-based Nordic Windpower will accelerate commercialization of the company's Swedish-designed, two-bladed wind turbines, marking the first utility-scale alternative to the industry's dominant three-bladed design in over a decade.</description>

While many onshore wind farms have been thwarted by a lack of adequate government support and widespread resistance at local level, offshore wind  is less prone to local objection (in theory at least) and has the potential to shoulder the bulk of the weight of meeting our 2020 renewable energy targets.  If all goes well, we should start to see many new offshore windfarms popping up round the coast over the next decade. Designing, manufacturing, constructing, operating and maintaining these new turbines will require a large workforce.</description>

      <title>StatoilHydro: Solid performance in a demanding m (Regulatory release)</title>
      <link>http://www.cisionwire.com/ext/statoilhydro/statoilhydro--solid-performance-in-a-demanding-m--regulatory-release-</link>
      <description>StatoilHydro's (OSE:STL, NYSE:STO) second quarter 2009 net operating&#xD;
income was NOK 24.3 billion, compared to NOK 62.6 billion in the&#xD;
second quarter of 2008. The quarterly result was negatively affected&#xD;
by a 40% drop in oil prices, an 18% decrease in the average price of&#xD;
natural gas and a 9% reduction in liftings of liquids, partly offset&#xD;
by a 4% increase in lifted gas volumes and improved margins for&#xD;
natural gas.</description>

      <description>MOVES to allow wind farms to expand have sparked fear of more turbines along the North Wales coast.&#xD;
Power companies are now able to extend offshore wind farms to provide a further 2GW capacity.&#xD;
Activists say the government’s decision could involve the growth of existing wind farms at North Hoyle, the currently under construction Rhyl Flats, and the future Gwynt y Môr development.</description>

      <title>A matter of priorities</title>
      <link>http://www.theengineer.co.uk/articles/312544/A+matter+of+priorities.htm</link>
      <description>Engineers are wearily resigned to the wider world’s general indifference over how something is produced. Most people are far more concerned with how effectively an engineered product works and how much it will cost them and, on the whole, glaze over at the first mention of the manufacturing process behind it. &#xD;
&#xD;
Natural enough I suppose, but Don Potts, an environmental advisor to Volvo, makes the valid point that if we want to shift our economy onto a genuinely sustainable base we all need to be a lot more aware of the whole picture.</description>

      <title>Number of wind turbines to quadruple under Renewable Energy Strategy</title>

      <description>Ministers have put wind power at the heart of a Renewable Energy Strategy, which is due to be released on Wednesday. It will outline how Britain is to meet its target of a 34 per cent cut in CO2 emissions by 2020. &#xD;
The Government’s plans are likely to include more than 4,000 additional onshore turbines by 2020, many built at beauty spots and on high ground which would make them visible across miles of open countryside. &#xD;
Another 3,000 turbines would be installed at sea — some of them visible from the coast, though others could be up to 100 miles offshore. Ministers are considering several measures to push wind farm planning applications through more quickly.</description>

      <link>http://www.pr-inside.com/research-and-markets-the-world-offshore-r1431903.htm</link>
      <description>The new edition of The World Offshore Wind Market Report examines the current and future prospects, technologies and markets for the offshore wind energy sector&#xD;
The industry is now moving quickly, and construction and tendering activity is at an all-time high. Offshore wind is forecast to see euro21 billion of capital expenditure in the coming five year period as 6.5 GW of new capacity is installed. With just over 1.5 GW of capacity currently installed, this represents significant market growth and leads to an annual capital expenditure of over euro5.6bn by 2013.</description>

      <description>• Revenue was DKK 959 million ahead at DKK 28,779 million, reflecting higher&#xD;
gas production from the Ormen Lange field, partly offset by significantly lower&#xD;
oil and gas prices and lower Danish power prices &#xD;
• EBITDA was down DKK 1,885 million at DKK 4,766 million, substantially due to&#xD;
the effects of timing differences in connection with the huge fluctuations in&#xD;
market prices for oil, gas and coal &#xD;
• Profit after tax was DKK 1,335 million versus DKK 3,082 million&#xD;
• DONG Energy invested DKK 8.5 billion in new activities and existing&#xD;
facilities, including gas-fired power station projects in Wales and the&#xD;
Netherlands, a Polish wind farm and the wind turbine installation company&#xD;
A2SEA.</description>

      <description>The Danish windfarm company Vestas told more than 400 UK employees today that they had been made redundant, marking the official closure of its Isle of Wight factory that had been occupied for 18 days by angry workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
The campaign to save the only major wind turbine blade manufacturer in the UK became a cause celebre for unions and green activists, who argued the move undermined the government's promise of a "green revolution" that would result in the installation of 10,000 wind turbines by 2020 and create thousands of jobs.</description>

      <title>Dong Steps up Wind Investment</title>
      <link>http://www.power-technology.com/news/news61749.html</link>
      <description>Denmark’s Dong Energy massively increased wind power investment in the first half of 2009 to DKK 8.5bn, compared to DKK 2.79bn in 2008. However, it plans to cut back spending next year. &#xD;
&#xD;
The 2009 investment includes DKK 3.33bn for wind power development, made up of DKK 0.7bn for acquiring A2SEA, and DKK 0.92bn and DKK 0.91bn for two offshore wind farms: Horns Rev 2 and Gunfleet Sands. &#xD;
&#xD;
Total investments this year are projected to amount to DKK 20bn on par with earlier projections but the economic downturn has meant 2010 and 2011 investments are projected at DKK 15 to 20bn per year – a drop from the proposed DKK 20bn.</description>

      <title>Bring on solar power; wind turbines are noisy and blot the horizon</title>

      <description>The British Wind Energy Association says: “Well-designed wind turbines are, generally, quiet in operation and, compared [with] the noise of road traffic, trains, aircraft and construction activities . . . the sound of a wind turbine generating electricity is likely to be the same level as noise from a flowing stream 50 m to 100 m away or the noise of leaves rustling in a gentle breeze.”</description>

      <title>Interim financial report, second quarter 2009 - No. 1 in Modern Energy retains its forecast for 2009</title>
      <link>http://www.vestas.com/files//Filer/EN/Investor/Company_announcements/2009/090818_CA_UK_18.pdf</link>
      <description>Vestas generated second-quarter revenue of EUR 1,211m, an increase of 11 per cent, realising a decline in EBIT of 15 per cent to EUR 78m relative to Q2 2008. In general, quarter-on-quarter fluctuations are due to changes in the activity level and variations in the contract types. Net working capital stood at 11 per cent of expected annual revenue, against (1) per cent the year before. The order backlog of firm and unconditional orders amounted to EUR 4.0bn at 30 June 2009. In spite of the weak order intake since the onset of the credit crisis, Vestas retains its forecast for 2009. Since the end of the reporting period, Vestas has recorded an order intake of EUR 0.7bn with unchanged payment patterns. Additionally, Vestas’ corporate Contract Review Board will be evaluating several contracts with a total value of more than EUR 4.4bn in the upcoming period. On 28 April, Vestas announced the necessity of lay-offs in Northern Europe due to lack of demand. In Denmark, 1,142 employees were laid off, whilst 425 employees were made redundant in the UK last week. At the same time, Vestas continues to expand its new factories in the USA and China. As from Q2 2009, Vestas will be reporting on quarterly developments in its non-financial highlights in order to give prominence to the performance in achieving its environmental and safety targets.</description>

      <title>Ill winds abate for battered sector</title>

      <description>Wind energy has suffered a battering in the financial storm of the past year but, as one of the most mature renewables, it looks set for a period of calm.&#xD;
&#xD;
The industry, dominated by European companies, offers steady returns over the lifespan of a turbine – two to three decades – but requires intensive capital spending, and projects are often at the mercy of government subsidies.&#xD;
&#xD;
In 2008 it showed strong growth. Global wind power capacity increased 29 per cent to 121 gigawatts, more than double the 48GW that existed in 2004, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. The market for installing turbines was worth $47.5bn.</description>

      <title>Statkraft – Q2 2009 - Acceptable results in a turbulent market</title>
      <link>http://www.statkraft.com/pro/press/Press_releases/2009/2_q_acceptable_results_in_a_turbulent_market.asp</link>
      <description>The Statkraft Group’s gross operating revenues rose by 8 per cent in the six months to 30 June. The increase is primarily attributable to earnings from the power plants acquired from E.ON AG at the turn of the year. The rise in revenues was, however, less than expected owing to the sharp fall in German electricity prices compared with first-half 2008. Lower gas power production in Germany coincided with a fall in earnings from Norwegian hydropower, bringing about a weaker underlying result.</description>

      <description>Germany has marked a milestone in the development of its offshore wind power industry with the startup of the Alpha Ventus wind farm in the North Sea.&#xD;
&#xD;
A consortium of E.On, Vattenfall and RWE says that the first three of the wind farm’s 12 wind turbines have supplied electricity to the German power grid. A further five turbines have already been completed and the consortium expects that all 12 units will be in operation by the end of 2009.</description>

      <title>Nordex Gets Council's OK to Raise Bonds to $125M</title>
      <link>http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article.aspx?aID=116786.54928.128924&amp;cID=5</link>
      <description>The Jonesboro City Council last week approved Nordex USA's request to increase its industrial development bonds to $125 million. &#xD;
&#xD;
The city had authorized up to $100 million in bonds, but the company thought that might not be enough to cover the construction costs of the approximately $100 million wind turbine manufacturing plant, said Nordex chief counsel Richard Casey.</description>

      <title>Keep the Blades Turning</title>
      <link>http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/08/keep-the-blades-turning</link>
      <description>Wind farm O&amp;M covers turbines and the critical connection to the grid. Here, tips on how to improve operations and decrease costs.&#xD;
Wind turbines are like every other power generation technology: where there are moving parts, there's wear and tear. Ongoing maintenance is crucial. But the source of stress on a wind turbine is unique -- constant exposure to the elements -- and utility-scale wind farm operational history is still being written.&#xD;
“Many of the country’s wind farms are still relatively new and preventative maintenance will become more important as they age,” said Richard Esce, business development manager at HMT Inc., a New York-based company that provides high voltage maintenance and engineering services to wind farms.</description>

      <title>Offshore Wind Farms Could Power 37 Million Homes by 2020</title>
      <link>http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/story.aspx?id=10588639</link>
      <description>Global offshore wind farm capacity will grow at a compound annual rate of 32 per cent in the coming decade, according to a new report by energy consulting firm ODS-Petrodata. &#xD;
&#xD;
The International Offshore Wind Market to 2020 report predicts that by the end of 2020 global offshore wind farm capacity will have soared to 55 gigawatts, or enough to power almost 37 million European homes. Current installed capacity is under two gigawatts. &#xD;
&#xD;
Based on an analysis of more than 700 projects and prospects in the company's database, ODS-Petrodata forecasts USD 61.4 billion of capital expenditure in the sector between now and 2014. For 2016 to 2020, total capital expenditure could be double that.</description>

      <title>Maine alternative energy leaders hit Europe on trade mission</title>

      <description>Maine Gov. John Baldacci and a group of clean energy business officials are heading to Europe next month to showcase the state’s wind and ocean energy capabilities to the world’s leading renewable energy developers.&#xD;
...Maine has lofty goals for wind farm development — some 2,000 megawatts installed by 2015 and 3,000 megawatts by 2020 — and developing projects offshore will likely be necessary to achieve that goal. A 2007 task force on wind power development suggested that some 10 percent of the state’s 2020 goal could come from offshore resources, yet Germany is one of the few places that has successfully brought offshore wind power online and industry experts expect European developers to find attractive projects in Maine.</description>

      <link>http://www.theengineer.co.uk/articles/312802/EWEA+predicts+wind+energy+increase.htm</link>
      <description>New research by the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) estimates that 8,600MW of new wind energy capacity will be installed in the European Union (EU) in 2009, a growth of one per cent compared to 2008. &#xD;
&#xD;
This would take the EU’s cumulative installed capacity to 73,535MW, up from 2008’s cumulative capacity of 64,935MW.&#xD;
&#xD;
The forecast is encouraging in a year where the financial crisis has affected most industries and where electricity demand is declining in tune with overall economic activity.</description>

      <description>South Carolina's entry into the high-stakes race to build an offshore wind farm began quietly this year when crews placed two strings of yellow buoys off the Grand Strand. &#xD;
Packed with weather instruments, these buoys will measure wind speeds to identify a sweet spot, a place close enough to shore so crews can more easily build and maintain a wind farm, but far enough into a powerful belt of winds that regularly blows off the coast -- winds strong enough to spin massive rotors on towers taller than the Statue of Liberty.</description>

      <title>Renewables Grid Initiative advocating new transmission lines</title>
      <link>http://www.leonardo-energy.org/drupal/renewables-grid-initiative-advocating-new-transmission-lines</link>
      <description>NGOs and TSOs join forces&#xD;
Historically, environmentally conscious NGOs and Transmission System Operators (TSOs) were for the most part diametrically opposed on the subject of high-voltage transmission lines. This makes it all the more remarkable that now two NGOs, including WWF, have joined an initiative that advocates an enforcement of the European transmission grid. Such enforcement is considered necessary to enable the integration of renewable energy systems.</description>

      <description>China's top legislature yesterday turned its attention to the creation of specific plans for more renewable energy, such as nuclear, wind and solar power.&#xD;
&#xD;
The move would not only create more energy that is desperately needed in China, but would also spur industry and business development, environmental experts say.</description>

      <title>Favorable Political Winds Blow E.U. Turbine Producers to the U.S.</title>
      <link>http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/08/25/25climatewire-favorable-political-winds-blow-eu-turbine-pr-51428.html</link>
      <description>After an early lead in wind power generation, the United States was completely overtaken by Europe in the 1980s and 1990s, when countries such as Denmark, Germany and Spain subsidized the industry and helped it survive some very lean years. Now, those investments have paid off. Denmark's Vestas, which started making turbines in 1979 and has since increased its efficiency by 100 times, is now the world's largest producer of wind turbines.&#xD;
&#xD;
Spain's Gamesa and Germany's Siemens are also big players in the industry. But the pace of onshore turbine installation in northern Europe has tapered off lately and the offshore sector is still in its infancy, plagued by technical and financial difficulties, so companies like Vestas are looking for continued growth elsewhere. With the Obama administration promising big investments in green energy, wind turbine producers see the United States as the key to the industry's future.</description>

      <link>http://www.finansnyheder.dk/news/ShowNewsStory.aspx?StoryId=10590875</link>
      <description>There will be fewer of the big state licensing rounds in the Chinese wind market in the future. At least when it comes to projects in the country, according to the forecast by wind consultancy company Make Consulting. &#xD;
&#xD;
- Based on our assessment of projects under development, we foresee a diminished share of the bidding rounds in the near future. And at some time the bidding round will disappear from the Chinese market, states Make Consulting in a memo.&#xD;
...&#xD;
- We believe that the remaining bidding rounds will take place in China's offshore sector, states the memo. &#xD;
&#xD;
China is one of the major areas of focus for the Danish wind turbine producer Vestas future.</description>

      <description>Already an aggressive investor in renewable energy projects such as solar power, PG&amp;E on Wednesday said it is seeking to build its first-ever facility that would pump compressed air into an underground cavern, using mainly wind energy produced during nonpeak hours, and release it to generate electricity during periods of peak demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 300-megawatt facility, to be built in Kern County, is projected to cost $356 million and take five years to design and build, said PG&amp;E spokesman Paul Moreno.&#xD;
&#xD;
On Wednesday, the San Francisco-based utility filed for $25 million in federal funding to be used for initial analysis and design costs.</description>

      <link>http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/08/signs-of-impact</link>
      <description>Project numbers and developer feedback indicate that the economic stimulus package is on the right path to bolster activity within the wind industry. &#xD;
On July 9, the U.S. Treasury Department and U.S. Department of Energy released the guidance for how wind farm developers can access cash grants in lieu of the investment tax credit. The grants, which were part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA, also known as the stimulus bill), are expected to help get wind projects built while capital markets remain difficult. The program began accepting applications at the end of July.</description>

      <title>DOE and U.S. Treasury Award $502 Million for Renewable Energy Projects</title>
      <link>http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/news_detail.html?news_id=14877</link>
      <description>The U.S. Treasury Department and DOE jointly announced $502 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act cash assistance on September 1 to energy companies in lieu of earned federal tax credits. This first round of awards is designed to create additional upfront capital, enabling companies to create jobs and begin construction on projects that may have been stalled until now. Ultimately, the program is expected to provide more than $3 billion in financial support for clean energy projects by providing direct payments rather than federal tax credits. These payments will support an estimated 5,000 biomass, solar, wind, and other types of renewable energy production facilities in all regions of the country.</description>

      <description>During the campaign, President Obama laid out his vision for combating global climate change. Unfortunately, President Obama's original vision seems to have been all but forgotten. His original proposal included a call for a national renewable energy standard (RES) where, by the year 2025, a full quarter of the nation's electricity would be generated by renewable sources. He seems to have lost sight of this vision.</description>

      <link>http://www.projo.com/news/content/BI_POWER_CONTRACT_09-03-09_KEFJG18_v10.38aa8f7.html</link>
      <description>Deepwater Wind has submitted a proposal to National Grid for a contract to provide alternative energy to Block Island, which has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
Deepwater, a New Jersey-based start-up company, proposes installing five to eight wind turbines in waters about three miles from the island by 2012. The small wind farm, which would be the first of two the company is proposing in Rhode Island, would provide more than enough power for Block Island when the wind is blowing. Any excess would be fed through an underwater cable to the mainland and the grid that supplies power to the rest of the state.</description>

      <link>http://www.arbroathherald.co.uk/news/WINDFARM-PLAN-FISHERMEN-WILL-BE.5615083.jp</link>
      <description>THE COMPANY behind the proposed Bell Rock windfarm, Airtricity, has reassured Angus MP Mike Weir that they appreciate the concerns of local fishermen with regard to their plan and will ensure that early and detailed consultation is undertaken with them.&#xD;
Mr Weir had contacted the company following approaches by local fishermen concerned about the possible impact of the development on their businesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
The MP, who had raised concerns about the impact of offshore developments on the fishing industry as far back as 2004 during the committee stages of the Energy Act, said: "The assessment of the site is at an early stage including a strategic environmental assessment which is being undertaken by the Scottish Government</description>

      <description>With its own supplier of green electricity Hamburg wants the coal and nuclear group to get hold of Vattenfall customers in northern Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
...The supplier, a 100-percent subsidiary of Hamburg's urban water utilities must generate green electricity in the short term itself. Two wind turbines at the port, which can meet the needs of 8,000 households, will be put into operation next year. Investments in wind farms in the region as well as offshore in the North and Baltic Sea will be sought. "Energy from the region for the region" was the short-term goal, says CEO Michael Beckereit.</description>

      <title>Grid Connectivity: Invest in Alternative Energy's Missing Link</title>
      <link>http://seekingalpha.com/article/160331-grid-connectivity-invest-in-alternative-energy-s-missing-link</link>
      <description>In Great Britain, more than 60 gigawatts (GW) of power, a quarter of that from renewable sources, reportedly is waiting to be connected to the nation’s power grid. In California, electric utilities say they have little hope of meeting the state’s mandate of achieving 20% of their generation from green sources by 2010 largely because of delays in getting transmission lines licensed and built. Meanwhile in Brazil, work is underway on what will be the world’s longest power line, which is being built with high-voltage, direct-current (HVDC) technology because it is ideally suited for hooking up renewable energy sources located in remote regions of the country.</description>

      <title>Taking a Load Off Turbines</title>
      <link>http://www.pennenergy.com/index/articles/newsdisplay/s-135011638.html</link>
      <description>Commercial-scale 2-megawatt turbines installed around the country today cost about $3.5 million each, including construction, according to Windustry, a Minneapolis-based nonprofit that promotes renewable energy use. &#xD;
&#xD;
Construction costs are much higher for off-shore wind farms than for upland wind farms, according to Jason Fredette, director of investor and media relations for American Superconductor Corp., manufacturer of superconductor wires based in Devens. So in order to make wind power more readily available for consumers, off-shore wind farms would want to build as few turbines as possible to generate needed power.</description>

      <title>Key Issues For Future Of Wind Energy In Spain</title>
      <link>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090907142512.htm</link>
      <description>The journal Energy Policy has recently reported two studies that highlight some key issues for the future of wind energy in Spain. A team of engineers from the University of Zaragoza believes it is "technically viable and economically reasonable" for wind energy to account for 30% of Spain's overall energy production. A report by two researchers from the University of Alcalá (UAH) and the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), meanwhile, says the number of jobs generated by this sector in the European Union has increased by 226% since 2003.</description>

      <description>The superlative meets the pioneering spirit: "Thialf", the most powerful floating crane in the world is helping with the completion of Germany's first offshore wind farm, alpha ventus. Currently, the construction vessel is placing six steel foundations 30 metres deep on the seabed of the North Sea, approximately 45 kilometres north of the island of Borkum. Using these so-called ‘jacket’ foundations, the consortium of EWE, E.ON and Vattenfall will shortly erect six REpower 5M wind power turbines, each with a height of 155 metres above sea level.</description>

      <description>China’s excess production capacity is an “international concern” as goods that can’t be sold locally may be sent to markets that have shrunk amid the global slump, European Union Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton said. &#xD;
...&#xD;
No foreign wind-turbine maker has won a bid since 2005, it added last week. “There is a marked lack of consistency in the application of qualification criteria” for public procurement projects, the chamber said in an annual position paper on China. &#xD;
&#xD;
General Electric Co., Suzlon Energy Ltd., Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA and Vestas Wind Systems A/S were among companies bidding for 25 wind-energy projects with generation capacity of 5.25 gigawatts, according to the chamber.</description>

      <description>Work has begun on a multi-million pound substation at Salle as part of the Sheringham Shoal offshore windfarm development.&#xD;
&#xD;
The final hurdle before construction started was the granting of a newt licence from Natural England.&#xD;
&#xD;
Before work could start on the preparation of the substation site, the developers had to safeguard some possible site inhabitants, great crested newts.&#xD;
&#xD;
The great crested newt is the UK's largest newt species but due to diminishing numbers it has legal protection against harm and destruction of its natural habitat</description>

      <title>EWEA's opinion: European wind power reaches a milestone</title>

      <description>It is true, as the ancient proverb declares, that time waits for no man. It is equally true that, according to a variety of sayings, the world can be changed by dreams, imagination and hard work. &#xD;
&#xD;
The latest validation of those two axioms presented itself this past week when the perpetual counter established by the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) reached a milestone by recording wind power in Europe had generated more than 100 GWh of electricity since 1 January 2009. &#xD;
...&#xD;
Europe is also in the process of replicating this considerable success story with the booming offshore wind sector, which is set to experience an immense expansion in the next few years. &#xD;
&#xD;
Once the necessary offshore power grid is built, the supply chain is streamlined and the administrative obstacles are sorted out, the offshore wind sector will create for Europe staggering amounts of new, green, local, and affordable electricity.</description>

      <description>With the availability of credit and the confidence of investors both declining, 2009 is a difficult year for the global wind power industry. However, the global wind power industry is estimated to grow steadily under the concerns for energy security and global warming, the increasing electric demand in developing countries and the gradual reduction of wind farm construction costs. Besides, since wind power is one of the main solutions to reducing the emission of CO2, with government support by offering preferential policies. Policies and other factors will also help the development of wind power industry through the current financial crisis.</description>

      <title>Offshore Wind Power Group Promotes Interstate Collaboration to Jumpstart US Development</title>
      <link>http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/09/no_global_clima.php</link>
      <description>Let's face it, the US seriously lags behind Europe in terms of offshore wind farms...way behind. Which makes the New York Times piece on the US Offshore Wind Collaborative all the more interesting. The idea is to develop greater cooperation among states to really develop a complete offshore wind power industry in the US, rather than just plans for individual wind farms:&#xD;
&#xD;
The idea is to develop shared facilities such a manufacturing "headquarters" and maintenance stations, as well as greater cooperation in developing new transmission infrastructure and everything else needed to really get the US into the offshore wind power game.</description>

      <link>http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=a2nwrWP2JsJA</link>
      <description>Offshore wind may provide as much as 17 percent of European Union electricity demand by 2030, surging from almost nothing now as the bloc promotes renewable energy, an industry group said. &#xD;
&#xD;
Total installed capacity of offshore wind may jump to 150 gigawatts in 2030 from the current 1.5 gigawatts, the European Wind Energy Association said in a report released today. The share of EU energy consumption coming from renewables must more than double to 20 percent on average by 2020 under a new law for the bloc. Renewable sources include solar power and biomass.</description>

      <title>SKF invests in China - SKF doubles Dalian factory capacity and forms strategic partnership with Sinovel Wind Co. Ltd.</title>
      <link>http://www.skf.com/skf/news/html/popup_frame1.jsp?contentId=877682&amp;lang=en</link>
      <description>SKF has today inaugurated its previously announced investment in Dalian factory, Liaoning Province. The SEK 638 million investment was initiated in May 2008, and was the second phase of a project started in 2005, which brings the total investment up to SEK 1.1 billion. A 25,000 ? facility has been added adjacent to the existing factory, doubling the manufacturing capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The aim for this investment is to increase the manufacturing capacity for large and medium size bearings in China. This is in order to support the continuous business growth in China and other parts of Asia, especially in the areas of renewable energy, metalworking, mining, construction and industrial transmission industries. The number of employees will increase from currently 305 to a total of around 600 people when the production is running at full capacity. SKF in Dalian has received the Dalian Preferred Employer Award 2008 and the Dalian Trusted Employer Award 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Today SKF also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for strategic partnership with Sinovel Wind Co. Ltd., one of the largest wind turbine manufacturers in China. This MoU will create a platform to build a preferred supplier/customer relationship between SKF and Sinovel. The cooperation under this MoU will cover supply chain service system optimization, staff training and development, engineering development and design, as well as resources management.</description>

economic viability, are enjoying a major&#xD;
boost from the growing offshore wind&#xD;
business. One estimate is that the value&#xD;
of wind farm construction work, excluding&#xD;
turbine manufacture, available to UK&#xD;
ports alone could be as much as £1 billion&#xD;
in the period up to 2020. The result&#xD;
has been increasing competition to gain&#xD;

      <title>Funding obstructs EU offshore wind boom - EWEA</title>
      <link>http://uk.biz.yahoo.com/13092009/323/funding-obstructs-eu-offshore-wind-boom-ewea.html</link>
      <description>Enough offshore wind projects are planned to meet one tenth of Europe's energy needs, but not all will emerge due to scarce finance and connections to the power grid, the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) says. &#xD;
Wind farm capacity on land grew by around 30 percent a year during an explosive decade of growth up to 2004, and EWEA has targeted similar growth for the European Union offshore sector in the next decade. &#xD;
That would lead to cumulative investments of around 57 billion euros ($83 billion) until 2020 to build 40 gigawatts of generating capacity, which could meet about 4 percent of EU energy needs. &#xD;
But bigger plans are already under way, with over 100 gigawatts of offshore wind projects in some stage of planning, EWEA says in its report 'Oceans of Opportunity'. &#xD;
&#xD;
'If realised, these projects would produce 10 percent of the EU's electricity,' said the report, which will be launched on Monday</description>

      <title>Event news: Fact or fantasy – can offshore wind really deliver by 2020?</title>

      <description>STOCKHOLM - Are European offshore sector players fantasising when they bandy about phrases like 50 per cent wind power by 2050? Given that offshore wind energy currently supplies under   per cent of Europe’s power, and that substantial grid and technology development needs to happen before it expands much further, isn’t the industry being unrealistic?</description>

      <description>STOCKHOLM — Building a new energy system for Europe by 2030 may seem like a daunting task since it will require thoughtful planning, exhaustive research, proper engineering, billions of Euros and faith that the end product will be efficient, affordable and long lasting. &#xD;
&#xD;
But the quicker that a pan-European electricity super highwaystarts taking advantage of the vast potential of wind energy located in the North, Irish and Baltic Seas, the better.</description>

      <description>The UK is set to be the birthplace of the world’s biggest wind turbine blades, according to Energy and Climate Secretary Ed Miliband. &#xD;
&#xD;
Miliband said, ‘With strong government backing, the UK is consolidating its lead in offshore wind energy. We already have more offshore wind energy than any other country, we have the biggest wind farm in the world about to start construction, and now we’ll see the biggest turbine blades in the world made here in Britain. Our coastline means the offshore wind industry has the potential to employ tens of thousands of workers by 2020, manufacturing, transporting, installing and operating new turbines.’</description>

      <description>State considers huge turbines off Ocean City, launches impact study&#xD;
The state began its pursuit of offshore wind generation Tuesday, a move that could lead to building 400-foot-tall turbines off Ocean City.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Maryland Energy Administration asked wind developers to express their interest in building industrial-size windmills a dozen or more miles off the state's 31-mile coastline. At the same time, the energy agency said it is launching a study to gauge the economic viability and environmental impact of such a project.</description>

      <description>AMERICAN investor Warren Buffett is considering making a £1 billion bet on Britain’s green energy revolution. &#xD;
&#xD;
The government wants to make Britain the world’s largest offshore wind energy generator, but the plans require hundreds of miles of undersea cables to bring the electricity ashore to the national grid. &#xD;
&#xD;
The network is expected to cost more than £12 billion and regulator Ofgem has launched an auction for the rights to build and maintain it.</description>

      <description>STOCKHOLM — It is fitting that a new plan to power Europe in the future with a massive increase in offshore wind energy was released today here in this historic 13th century city of islands on Sweden’s southeast coast where Lake Malaren meets the relentless Baltic Sea. &#xD;
&#xD;
Swedish mariners have known for more than eight centuries that the combined power of wind and water is an unstoppable force to be reckoned with, feared, admired and exploited.</description>

      <title>Offshore Wind: Europe Now, U.S. When</title>
      <link>http://seekingalpha.com/article/162581-offshore-wind-europe-now-u-s-when</link>
      <description>Every two years, the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) holds a major conference on offshore wind energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
The last time EWEA convened its offshore event, in December 2007 in Berlin, the mood was relatively somber. Several major offshore wind projects had been completed, but had run into unforeseen technical and economic challenges. European policies and regulations for the next phase of offshore wind energy were in flux. Although everyone was convinced that offshore wind was going to be a significant growth sector in the European energy mix, there were real doubts as to when such opportunities would actually come to fruition.</description>

      <title>Wind Energy: The Fall in Orders in 2009 Will Affect Revenues in 2010. New Growth Strategies Are Now Essential, Says Frost &amp; Sullivan</title>
      <link>http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/story.aspx?id=10629348</link>
      <description>Due to the strong growth and placement of wind turbine orders in 2008 and the lead time between placing the orders and shipping them out to customers, the top line for wind turbine manufacturers in 2009 has been relatively unaffected. However, the fall in orders in 2009 will affect revenues of these companies in 2010. Therefore, it is essential for companies to adopt new strategies to keep their margins intact. And some companies have already started taking extraordinary and urgent measures to sustain and accelerate growth in a tough environment.</description>

      <link>http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/09/we-can-do-that-u-s-states-scent-opportunity-and-jobs-in-wind-manufacturing</link>
      <description>In early summer, state reps attended the AWEA 2009 event in Chicago in force, vying for the attention of the European wind manufacturers that they hope will bring their states much-needed jobs. &#xD;
...&#xD;
State governments outside the nation’s windy midsection also are competing for renewable energy jobs. In the northeast, New York and Canada want to attract offshore wind farms, each to their own side of the Great Lakes, knowing that manufacturers tend to locate close to projects to avert transportation costs.</description>

      <title>Wind Power Giant Shows Interest in State ; Maine Officials Pitch the State's Turbine Siting Potential to Iberdrola, a Spanish Company That Owns CMP. Series: TRADE MISSION TO EUROPE</title>
      <link>http://www.pennenergy.com/index/articles/newsdisplay/s-135582324.html</link>
      <description>On the first official day of a trade mission focused on renewable energy, Gov. John Baldacci and about 10 business people from Maine visited Iberdrola, the parent company of Energy East. Energy East, in turn, is the parent of Central Maine Power Co., which has 600,000 customers in the state and employs more than 1,200 people. &#xD;
...&#xD;
Iberdrola has wind farms in Connecticut, Texas and on the West Coast. As Maine aggressively pursues wind projects for both the interior of the state and the embryonic offshore market, having Iberdrola, the "world leader in renewable energy," set up a project in the state would "back up Maine on the world stage," Baldacci said</description>

      <description>The wind power business will grow at a slower pace, buffeted by stiff competition from Europe and China, unless Congress approves climate change legislation, global industry leaders said Thursday.&#xD;
&#xD;
The leaders pressed their case at a Washington, D.C., news conference called as federal legislation is pending that would curb carbon emissions and require utilities to generate a percentage of electricity from renewable sources.</description>

Even if they can be seen from the shoreline, 67% support off-shore wind power, according to a new poll of coastal residents of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia , jointly commissioned by governors of the five states, in trying to see if there was any agreement on coastal development</description>

      <title>Dong Energy: 'Clean' Denmark's dirty secret</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2009/sep/17/greenwash-dong-energy</link>
      <description>The Danes like to think of themselves as green. Denmark is home to the world's largest wind turbine manufacturer, Vestas. And today, the giant state-owned energy company, Dong Energy, opens the world's largest windfarm.&#xD;
But the Danes have a dirty secret. For Dong Energy, while greening its image at home, is busy building coal-fired power stations elsewhere in Europe. First in Germany, and now in Scotland.</description>

      <title>China Backs Market Price for Wind Power</title>
      <link>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125387844979540747.html</link>
      <description>BEIJING -- A top Chinese energy policy official said Friday the price for wind power and other renewable energy should be set by market forces, rejecting calls for fixed prices, a system used in some countries to promote the use of renewable energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
As China looks to renewables to fill more of its energy needs, many Chinese power companies are looking to develop wind energy but are worried about profitability and thus looking for price guarantees.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Calls to set renewable energy prices at a high level through a fixed government price are mainly coming from investors," said Zhang Guobao, vice minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, at a press briefing. "But the result, if prices are fixed too high, would be to impact the widespread use of renewable energy."</description>

"It would be almost offensive for us to complain about this," said Hammerbacher, an executive at solar module manufacturer Canadian Solar Inc. &#xD;
&#xD;
Sure, we're hearing complaints from the wind industry about arbitrary turbine setbacks and how it will kill wind projects. We're also hearing the big solar developers sounding off about the building ban on Class 1 and 2 agricultural lands and how it will, well, kill solar projects.</description>

continue its rapid economic growth and provide for the millions of its poor while at the&#xD;
same time facing the challenge of developing in a more sustainable manner than it is now.&#xD;
A detailed analysis of the socioeconomic conditions and the energy resource endowment&#xD;
within countries of the region, their perceptions of energy vulnerability, an assessment&#xD;
of what are perceived to be real options to overcome the vulnerability and the barriers&#xD;
to exercising these options reveals an interesting, but challenging, mosaic of issues that&#xD;
would need to be address to facilitate the transition to a clean and secure energy future.</description>

      <title>Potential Investment in Clipper Windpower Plc</title>
      <link>http://www.clipperwind.com/pr_093009.html</link>
      <description>The Directors of Clipper Windpower Plc (“Clipper” or “the Company”) announced that the Company, as a result of a comprehensive capital raising process, has initiated discussions and received approaches from a number of parties comprising both industrial multinationals and financial investors that could lead to a significant investment in the Company. Subject to the size and structure of any transaction, it is expected that Clipper's new partner could range from owning a substantial minority position, investing at or around the current market price, to acquiring all of Clipper's outstanding share capital. These competitive discussions are at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that an investment could be announced and completed before the Company's financial year end. Any investment would be subject to shareholder approval. Despite the current advanced status of the discussions, there can be no certainty as to terms or structure, or that an investment will happen.</description>

      <description>Spanish energy engineering and construction company Acciona SA is considering the sale of part of its wind turbine manufacturing business, a company executive told the Jefferies clean energy conference in London. &#xD;
"Probably Acciona doesn't need 100 percent of that," investment relations spokeswoman Ines Prieto Ortega told Reuters.&#xD;
"I don't think you'll see an announcement in the short term, we shall see."&#xD;
The company would first concentrate on absorbing excess wind turbine inventory through 2010, Ortega said, adding that the business "is not going through its best year".</description>

      <description>The United States is viewed as one of the next big markets for offshore wind generation. Now that the Cape Wind project is considered more likely than not to proceed and the favorable political climate towards renewables, it is not a question of whether U.S. offshore wind farms will get built but how many.</description>

      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/oct/05/wind-farms-north-sea</link>
      <description>Radical plans are afoot in Britain to build wind farms in the North Sea. Terry Macalister sees how it works in Lillgrund, Sweden.&#xD;
Imagine what it is like to open the bonnet of your car, stand on top of the engine and be hoisted 85m above the North Sea on a perilously narrow pole. The view on a clear day is breathtaking, but when the wind is blowing so hard the whole contraption swings 4m from side to side, it is grim – even for Leif Bolther.</description>

      <description>One of the world’s oddest looking ships will anchor off the Suffolk coast this week. Think of a giant table, with legs nearly 290ft long, bobbing upside down in the sea. That is more or less what the Leviathan looks like. There are only two other “jack-up” boats like it — built to install the giant offshore windmills the government hopes will soon ring the British Isles.</description>

      <link>http://domesticfuel.com/2009/10/14/18097/</link>
      <description>Earlier this week, National Wind CEO Leon Steinberg, challenged President Obama to take a stand by insisting that legislators pass an energy bill establishing a federal oversight committee to implement an interstate transmission highway. Steinberg likens the challenge as similar to President “Ike” Eisenhower’s initiative of creating a federal interstate system. The only difference is that while the nation’s interstate system is for cars, the transmission highway is for electricity.</description>

      <description>A big factor limiting solar and wind power growth across the US is the current transmission network. It is disconnected. A new project proposed by Tres Amigas LLC in New Mexico would link the nation’s main power grids across the US and, therefore, give hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of households links to already existing renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>National Grid Gets Solar Okay, Rejects Deepwater Wind</title>
      <link>http://solar.coolerplanet.com/News/10280902-national-grid-gets-solar-okay%2c-rejects-deepwater-wind.aspx</link>
      <description>In a surprising development, National Grid, an East Coast regional utility, has gotten a thumbs up from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities for its five planned solar installations.&#xD;
The development is only surprising in view of the fact that National Grid recently put the screws to Deepwater Wind, an offshore wind farm planned for Rhode Island, off the coast of Block Island, by refusing to buy the electricity generated.</description>

      <title>Research and Markets: This Essential Report Analyzes the Global Offshore Wind Power Industry</title>
      <link>http://www.pr-inside.com/research-and-markets-this-essential-report-r1556182.htm</link>
      <description>Historically land-based wind energy has been dominant and is likely to remain dominant in the immediate future also. But of late installations at sea are becoming increasingly important. Compared to onshore wind, offshore wind is more complex and costly to install and maintain but they also come with certain advantages. The winds are much stronger and stable at sea, which automatically results in higher production per unit installed.</description>

      <description>A MAJOR push began last night to persuade green energy firms to make Lowestoft their operations base when building wind turbines off the East Anglian coast.&#xD;
The latest round of licences from the Crown Estate to build offshore windfarms includes “zone five” - an area just 25 kilometres out of Lowestoft.&#xD;
Yesterday the 1st East Urban Regeneration Company and Associated British Ports (ABP) and a series of public and private sector partners began to lobby for investment in the town.</description>

      <description>LAST June in a fjord in southwestern Norway, a 213-foot-tall wind turbine did something large wind turbines normally don’t do: it headed out to sea.&#xD;
Towed by tugboats, the newly built turbine, with three 139-foot rotor blades and a 2.3-megawatt generator atop the tower, which itself was bolted to a ballasted steel cylinder extending more than 300 feet below the waterline, made its way to a spot six miles off the coast. Once in position it was moored with cables to the seafloor, about 700 feet below.</description>

      <description>Seven new designs for offshore wind turbine foundations have been short-listed for funding by the Carbon Trust in Britain.&#xD;
The offshore wind turbine foundation designs are aimed at reducing the high costs associated with installing offshore wind turbines, where deepwater foundations comprise at least 20% of total project costs, says the Carbon Trust. Offshore wind currently costs £3 million a megawatt as many of the sites which are being tendered for development are farther from shore in deep water and in treacherous conditions.</description>

      <description>The V90-3.0 MW turbine from Vestas Americas improves on previous designs thanks to lightweight carbon fiber in  blades and stronger steel for a lighter tower. What’s more, a microprocessor controlled pitch regulator and  redesigned nacelle further improve the turbine’s performance. The company says minimizing weight was a matter of high priority.</description>

      <description>Two Siemens 3.6 MW wind turbines are taken into use in the Avedøre Holme district of Copenhagen, and will supply electricity to approx. 5,000 households.&#xD;
The winds of change are blowing through the Avedøre Holme district of Copenhagen. The 12 old wind turbines that used to stand there have been taken down, and in their place now stand two of the biggest wind turbines in serial production today – the Siemens 3.6 MW model – each of which has the same capacity as the previous 12. Between them they can supply enough electricity to meet the demands of around 5,000 households.</description>

      <description>It lags in the global wind power race—except in the fast-growing nautical niche.&#xD;
German engineering giant Siemens (SI) looks like an also-ran in wind turbines. It's in sixth place globally, with 7% of the market, well behind leaders Vestas and General Electric (GE). Yet the headquarters of Siemens Wind Power has plenty of bustle. Under the overcast skies of Denmark's Jutland peninsula, workers are putting the final touches on a vast parts warehouse.</description>

      <description>Wind turbine nacelles are challenging environments for drivetrains. Input forces (wind captured by blades) can vary ±20% in the span of just three seconds. Unstable drivetrain foundations generate misalignments and additional stress. And the moisture levels and temperatures extremes outdoors are generally worse than in factories.</description>

      <description>When Gov. Ted Kulongoski vetoed a bill this summer that would have slashed Oregon's tax subsidies for large wind farms, he insisted the reduction went too far and would jeopardize the growth of Oregon's green economy.&#xD;
But during the past eight years, while the state has taken applications for $300 million in tax breaks to subsidize the development of the windiest, most transmission-accessible sites, it has yet to do any substantive analysis of how big a subsidy is necessary -- if any -- to continue attracting investments.</description>

      <title>The Gearbox Standard for Windturbines gets an Upgrade</title>
      <link>http://www.windpowerengineering.com/2009/12/09/the-gearbox-standard-for-windturbines-gets-an-upgrade/</link>
      <description>The recently drafted ISO/IEC standard for wind-turbine gearboxes is significant for many reasons. First, several organizations collaborated to produce ANSI/AGMA/AWEA 6006-A03, which was adopted without change in 2005 as ISO 81400-4, an international standard. The new draft (IEC project 61400-4), expands on preceding standards so it is more encompassing. It provides a conduit through which manufacturers and users can specify and evaluate products. The new IEC standard is a bit overdue, but may have been worthy of the wait.</description>

      <title>Chinese Windmills and the Little Mermaid in Copenhagen</title>

      <description>Copenhagen, besides being the home to COP15, is also famous for its association with the fairytale author Hans Christian Andersen, who famously wrote "The Little Mermaid." &#xD;
As with the story of ‘The Little Mermaid,’ it had previously been assumed that renewable energy projects were popular. The issue at stake is tariffs. The EB suspects, but admits it has no evidence either way, that wind tariffs may have been set at a level that relied on the CDM to make them profitable.</description>

      <description>Thomas E. Gebhard argues in his Nov. 28 column, “Rhode Island’s renewable-energy suicide,” that Rhode Island leaders are committing “renewable-energy suicide” by supporting Deepwater Wind’s plans for two offshore wind farms. In fact, the opposite is true. [Deepwater struck a deal with National Grid last week in which the latter agreed to buy electricity from Deepwater, whose initial plans involve putting eight turbines off Rhode Island.]</description>

      <description>Power companies don't usually argue for aggressive cuts in the world's carbon emissions. Centrica PLC, the U.K.'s biggest energy supplier, is a rare exception.&#xD;
Sam Laidlaw, Centrica's chief executive officer, says at Copenhagen the European Union should pledge to cut heat-trapping CO2 emissions by 30% by 2020, not the planned 20%.</description>

      <description>VATTENFALL, Europe's fifth largest energy group, wants to have a further five onshore wind farms operating in Scotland within the next three years as part of its plans to become "climate-neutral" by 2050.&#xD;
The Swedish company's strategy includes using a mixture of renewable energy – from wind and wave sources – alongside nuclear power and "clean" coal and gas-fired power stations, fitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, to reach its target.</description>

      <title>Copenhagen: Emphasis should be on action plan</title>
      <link>http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/opinions/Copenhagen_Emphasis_should_be_on_action_plan_96008.shtml</link>
      <description>According to the recent World Population report, 2009, in the last century the world population increased from 1.65b to 6b and is expected to surpass 9b by 2050. &#xD;
Since the invention of steam engine, humans have replaced muscle, wind, and water power with the profligate use of fossil fuel. The use of fossil fuels to meet ever increasing demand, coupled with the culture of conspicuous consumerism has exponentially increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has resulted in the depletion of natural resources, and transformation of the environment.</description>

      <title>IEA: Energy Revolution Required to Combat Climate Change</title>
      <link>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=iea-energy-climate-change</link>
      <description>The International Energy Agency has analyzed exactly what it would take to limit greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.&#xD;
Revolutionizing the energy industry to achieve a target concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of no more than 450 parts per million (ppm) would require building 17 nuclear power plants a year between now and 2030; 17,000 wind turbines a year; or two hydropower dams on the scale of Three Gorges Dam in China, according to the International Energy Agency.</description>
